Looks like it’s time for another episode of “u/thiccdadsclub explains shit to retards”!

When you place an order with a broker, whether to buy or sell a security (be that options, futures, shares of a triple-leveraged ETF that tracks Chinese REITs, or even a “stock”, whatever that is) you imagine that your order gets sent from your broker to the exchange, right? You think your order to buy one share of the latest weed stock is sitting up there on a server in NASDAQ’s data center waiting to be matched to a seller. Wrong, idiot. God you’re so fucking 
*stupid*.

Your broker has agreements in place with companies called “market makers” or “liquidity providers” or “dark pools” or other terms. I’ll call them liquidity providers. Your order goes to them, and they decide whether to pass it on to the exchange or whether to fill it from their own personal vault of cash and securities.

For example, suppose a stock is trading with a bid of $100 and an ask of $101. You, an idiot, submit a market order to your broker to buy one share and I, a genius, submit a market order to my broker to sell one share. By chance, our brokers both send the orders to the same liquidity provider, who decides to close the trades internally rather than send them to the exchange. They buy my share at the bid of $100 and then sell that share to you at the ask of $101, pocketing $1 in the process.

Now the liquidity provider can’t just pick any damn price to fill the orders at. By law they have to stick to the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), which are the bid and ask prices that the average customer would see on the real exchange(s) that trade that particular security.

The liquidity provider is allowed to do *better* than the NBBO though. For example, suppose on the exchange that same stock is trading with an ask of $100 and a bid of $101 and again, you submit a market buy order and I submit a market sell order. The liquidity provider could buy my share for $100.25 and sell it to you for $100.75. They only make $0.50 instead of $1.00 but now they can claim that they offer tighter spreads than available on the exchange and retail customers like us wet our panties with excitement at all the money we’ll make. This is called “price improvement”.

If the orders are *limit* orders instead of market orders, then the liquidity provider has to check how the limit compares to NBBO to see what price they would have to fill it at and whether price improvement is possible. For example, if your buy order had a limit of no more than $100.60 and my sell order had a limit of no less than $100.40 then the liquidity provider has to decide whether to fill internally at those prices, providing huge price improvement and only a $0.20 profit, or pass it on to the exchange.

Now note two important things. First, if there’s no volume for the security then there’s no NBBO and the liquidity provider isn’t going to fill it internally. This doesn’t really happen with stocks but with options you can pick stupid strike prices where there’s nobody buying or selling. The liquidity provider should send those orders to the exchange where they will wait until somebody wants them or they are canceled.

Second, the liquidity provider should never provide such huge price improvement that the customer sees a negative spread. Suppose you submit your limit buy order with a limit of $95 this time, far less than the national best bid. The liquidity provider would be stupid to fill that internally; it’s basically a guaranteed loss for them and a guaranteed profit for you.

A long iron condor is a set of four options contracts that are ordered at once. It doesn’t really matter what they are or why somebody would want one, just know that when you open a long iron condor you are placing four orders: 2 limit buys and 2 limit sells. All four orders have to fill or none are filled. When you open a long iron condor you immediately receive a credit. If all four options eventually expire worthless you keep the full credit; otherwise you lose some or all of it depending on what happens. You want the underlying security to be stable in price and the options to expire worthless.

It’s really easy to create an order for a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless; just pick ridiculous strike prices for the four “legs” of the order. But of course there won’t be any volume for an iron condor like that, because who would be taking the other side of that trade? To make it doubly worthless you could set your limits such that it would create a negative spread. The order should never fill; no human being would ever take the other side of that trade, paying way too much for worthless contracts.

But who needs a human being when you have a liquidity provider with buggy software and a broker with an appetite for risk!

Two users (the aforementioned u/aidangamer28 and u/bearhobag) have found that using Robinhood under certain conditions you can open a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless and has a ridiculous limit price and it *will* be filled... by Robinhood’s liquidity provider! And worse still, Robinhood will let you use that net credit to boost your leverage immediately, so you don’t even have to wait for the options to expire before spending the money (on more iron condors, obv.)

Essentially it seems that Robinhood’s liquidity provider (Citadel Trading or Virtu Financial) has a bug that causes them to internally fill orders for long iron condors with (1) low volume and (2) stupid limits. These orders should have gone to the exchange where nobody would take them, but instead they are being filled at whatever limit price the user asks for, even if that means an effective negative spread. I suggest we call this the “infinite price improvement” cheat code.

Hope that helps, don’t @ me you losers

Edit: It’s very unclear at this point what combinations of underlying securities, strike prices, and limits will exploit this bug. Both posters provided proof that satisfied the mods, but it only takes a hearty dick to satisfy the mods so.. 

It’s also unclear whether this is illegal or not. On the surface it seems that if Citadel wants to buy your shitty iron condors at your shitty prices then hey, that’s their business, keep selling them until they’re bankrupt. On the other hand, prison would suck.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends from &lt;a href=""/r/all""&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; are quite confused about this latest Robinhood fuckup!&lt;/p&gt;

for the all new, Robinhood Infinite Money Glitch! What you have to do is find a company that offers high payouts for short term, low risk iron condors. For example you can buy two out of the money calls and two in the money puts and still get offered $30 for every $100 you spend, or an even better amount like I’ve been finding, example $50 for every $100 I spend, (and buy $100 I mean 1 iron condor and for $30 and $50 I mean the min credit you’d be receiving for buying 1 iron condor) and since these calls and puts are always very far away from the actual stock price you have a very low chance of the iron condor actually failing you if the stock goes up or down. 
  
I’ve been doing this to FB, TTWO, GOOGL, and AMZN. For example this iron condor is on TTWO (take two interactive), for the iron condor, I’m selling a 130 call, buying a 131 call, selling a 117 put, and buying a 116 put all expiring 12/6, and the price of TTWO is now $121. (LOOK AT THE PICTURES) The limit price for this trade is .03 but with the crazy bid ask spread price that happens after hours, Robinhood will ask you to put in your own limit price of .95 specifically for this trade, you’ll put that in the limit price section, then you will make $95 instead of $3 with an $100 collateral, and once Friday comes along you will have made $195 off of a $100 trade!
 
 (Next few sentences is pretty much what I just said but these sentences go for any stock and not just TTWO) Then what you do is buy however many iron condors of this trade you want. When you accept everything on the order page of the iron condor, it will ask you credit or debit, choose credit, then it will say this iron condor has a special bid ask spread and it will ask you to choose a limit price. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Right then and there you have to choose the special bid ask spread in the limit price section. In my example it gave me a .95 limit price giving me $95 for every $100 iron condor. Then you place the order and it will get placed when the market opens (or by the end of the market day). 
  
If the order doesn’t get placed because the limit price is too high, try lowering it by .10, if you can’t completely double your money with this iron condor this method will still work as long as you gain 50% of what the colateral cost is, so if you’re lucky and can find a regular iron condor offering 50% of what the colateral cost is, then you don’t even have to mess around with the limit price and that will insure the order gets placed! And yes you need someone to actually sell you the iron condor too and that’s what makes this glitch awesome as it gets filled with this ridiculous limit price. 
  
IF YOU’RE CONFUSED LOOK AT THE PICTURES AT THE END OF THIS POST AND THAT WILL HELP EXPLAIN EVERYTHING! Yes this does seem to be a somewhat weird iron condor trade so far but here’s the thing, you’re doubling the money your investing using margin so margin will also double the total amount of money it can lend to you, this will lead to unlimited gains/money! Then you keep on doing this method until this glitch gets patched and then we can all buy out google, we’ll all run the board and then we can take out assets and throw one huge damn party!!!!! 
  
See you all on Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Market Watch, Buisness Insider and Fox! By the way I can’t figure out a way to show my margin doubling so the picture is of GUH instead! I love you all wallstreetbets! Promise too bail me out of prison if the SEC finds me! GUH’s speed to all of you degenerates!

Edit 1: and when I say you receive $195 I mean that’s how much money you’ll get back that margin will double! GUH’s speed to all of you degenerates! 
  
Edit 2 (3:54PM December 1st 2019): Jartek (creator of WSB) has stickied my post to the top of WSB and proved my credibility that this method does in fact work. I will not post any pictures of the specific past trades I have done even to prove credibility because if I do that I I’ll in fact get caught and probably get in trouble. Though I did send those pictures to Jartek to prove my credibility to him. Also I added paragraphs for you autist degenerates who don’t know how to read a big chuck of writing.

I wrote myself some scripts to interact with the Robinhood API back in March. While testing them out I found something weird. If you bought options with the bid/ask at 0.00/0.01 and then tried to sell them back with a multi-leg order, Robinhood would buy them back at 0.01 each.

The bid/ask was at 0.00/0.01. You would buy for 0.01. When you tried to sell back, the bid/ask would still be 0.00/0.01, so you should not have been able to sell. Yet the RH API would let you sell for 0.01. You could buy as many shit 0.00/0.01 options you wanted, your RH net worth graph would drop (reflecting your poor choice), and then you could get them all refunded and your RH net worth graph would go back up.

This never failed and I never had any money taken out of my account as a result.

I always thought this was an API-specific bug, and I was too scared to investigate it and risk legal trouble.

My guess is that /u/Aidangamer28's iron condors are erroneously getting filled due to a similar Robinhood order-flow bug. He accidentally found a way to abuse the bug I was too scared to look into.

Edit:
You could buy options for $0.01 and hold them for a couple of days (didn't try more). If they went to $0.00, you could get a full refund. If they went to $0.02 (happened in one of my tests), you would double your money.

That’s 20x return with a 95% success rate every single time.   
  
When a user fills with their coverage for $100 collateral, the system does a check for a $5 funding option but also calculates the potential $95 initial gain. This way, RH thinks they are safe from any shenanigans, or god forbid, malarkey, that a typical WSB autist such as myself would perform.
  
But I know that you don’t care about the intricacies. HOW IS THIS CHEATCODE FOR FREE MONEY DONE, YOU ASK? How does it work? Here’s the rundown:    
  
EDIT: just to clarify since some people are saying that I wrote out “too much detail”, I’m just trying to prevent the next housing crisis (yeah, that’s how big this problem is. You see The Big Short?). You’re welcome in advance, homeowners. 
  
1. Buyer fat fingers fill in a $0.01 purchase per stock option alongside the $100 collateral (explained later).

&lt;p&gt;When a user fills with their coverage for $100 collateral, the system does a check for a $5 funding option but also calculates the potential $95 initial gain. This way, RH thinks they are safe from any shenanigans, or god forbid, malarkey, that a typical WSB autist such as myself would perform.&lt;/p&gt;

What I’m mainly looking at, is the fact that out of 15k stores, our store in the top 100 beat by 15% more or less.

So Puts ITM. I’ll throw 1k on it. SHORT DG

I’m 80% sure on this. But if I’m wrong and you lose money just remember that you listened to a random guy on the internet. On the other hand if you win bigly, remember that it was all thanks to a guy on the internet. Good luck

Also this is my first ever DD, so dont hold back

[SwaggyStonks - WSB Analyzer and YOLO tracker.](https://www.swaggystocks.com)

&amp;#x200B;

It contains a WSB '**Sentiment' analyzer**, **Due Diligence** tracker, and a **YOLO tracker**.

I've recently added a new section that will contain full, in-depth ""Due Diligence"" reports on certain companies that will include all the data someone needs to know about the company if they want to trade their stock.

**Quick ""How it works""**

I log positions of posts flagged as ""YOLO/Gains/Losses"" and post them to my site. For actual options YOLO plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the win/loss percent. Every position on the site links back to it's appropriate thread on WallStreetBets so you can take a look and read the comments/juicy details as well! All other gains, losses, and expired YOLOs are placed in the ""Expired YOLOs"" section.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note I do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the OP of the YOLO disappears in which case I let the YOLO ride until expiry. It's fun to see what they could be worth!

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Cool Features The Site Has:**

\-**Top YOLO**s section (sorted by upvotes, gains, and losses)

\-**Competitor Analysis Tool**: Compare fundamentals/financials for different tickers.

\-**Options Scanner Tool**: View historical estimated ""prices"" of options. A good tool to view which options are currently expensive or cheap at different ranges of OTM.

\-**Credit Spread Finder**: Search tickers and find how much premium you can receive at 'x' percentage of being OTM and how much you are risking.

\-**Dividend Screener**: Search stocks that offer a dividend and filter them by: sector, dividend amount, and dividend frequency.

If anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!

**Losingest Tickers**

SPY, ATVI, AAPL, TSLA, AMZN","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you that aren&amp;#39;t familiar with the site I created, it&amp;#39;s at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.swaggystocks.com""&gt;SwaggyStonks - WSB Analyzer and YOLO tracker.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It contains a WSB &amp;#39;&lt;strong&gt;Sentiment&amp;#39; analyzer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Due Diligence&lt;/strong&gt; tracker, and a &lt;strong&gt;YOLO tracker&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently added a new section that will contain full, in-depth &amp;quot;Due Diligence&amp;quot; reports on certain companies that will include all the data someone needs to know about the company if they want to trade their stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick &amp;quot;How it works&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I log positions of posts flagged as &amp;quot;YOLO/Gains/Losses&amp;quot; and post them to my site. For actual options YOLO plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the win/loss percent. Every position on the site links back to it&amp;#39;s appropriate thread on WallStreetBets so you can take a look and read the comments/juicy details as well! All other gains, losses, and expired YOLOs are placed in the &amp;quot;Expired YOLOs&amp;quot; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note I do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the OP of the YOLO disappears in which case I let the YOLO ride until expiry. It&amp;#39;s fun to see what they could be worth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Cool Features The Site Has:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Top YOLO&lt;/strong&gt;s section (sorted by upvotes, gains, and losses)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Competitor Analysis Tool&lt;/strong&gt;: Compare fundamentals/financials for different tickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Options Scanner Tool&lt;/strong&gt;: View historical estimated &amp;quot;prices&amp;quot; of options. A good tool to view which options are currently expensive or cheap at different ranges of OTM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Credit Spread Finder&lt;/strong&gt;: Search tickers and find how much premium you can receive at &amp;#39;x&amp;#39; percentage of being OTM and how much you are risking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Dividend Screener&lt;/strong&gt;: Search stocks that offer a dividend and filter them by: sector, dividend amount, and dividend frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Godspeed bois&lt;/p&gt;

I'm here to propose an idea that will have us in yachts, fucking hookers and doing blow in no time.

#Introducing the r/wallstreetbets Hedge Fund!

We're over 700k in this sub, if we should all contribute $10 each, that'll give us $7million.

The money will be given to the manager of the fund (me of course) to invest in behalf of the sub!

Everybody will be a shareholder.

Now, using advanced strategies I've learned from the greats like u/Analfarmer2, u/1ronyman and u/ControlTheNarrative, I can expertly sell puts and buy calls, making us a shitload of tendies monthly.

I currently have $18.67 under management, projected  to grow exponentially, so you can tell I'm an expert and this can't go tits up.


Dividends will be distributed yearly to all members of the sub.

For those asking about insurance, I'm the Prince of Nigeria.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 2nd, 2019.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/december-could-be-good-for-the-stock-market-but-theres-one-big-risk.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks have had a bang-up year so far, and they’re heading straight into the month that is often the best of all.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 25% for the year. Thanksgiving week was technically positive for the market, with the small cap Russell 2000 breaking out, joining other indexes in an uptrend.
*****
&gt; Stocks, however, were lower Friday in sluggish trading after the Thanksgiving holiday. Through Wednesday, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 had all popped to new record highs, with consumer discretionary and tech names leading the market higher this past week. The Russell 2000 is not yet back to its highs, but it pushed above its previous 52-week high, in a healthy sign for the overall market.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, investor focus will move more intently to the topic of trade, and that is what will make or break the rally at year-end.

&gt; President Donald Trump has promised that a preliminary trade deal with China is close, but there still is no agreement and the Dec.15 deadline for new tariffs is getting closer. Trump’s signing of legislation Wednesday supporting the Hong Kong protesters drew a negative reaction from Beijing and adds more uncertainty to trade talks.
*****
&gt; The health of the economy is also a factor for markets, and there is some key data, with the ISM manufacturing report on Monday followed by the government’s all-important monthly jobs data on Friday.
*****
&gt; # Best month of year
&gt; 2019 has turned out to be a very good year for the market, with the Jan. 1 to Thanksgiving Day period the 14th best for the S&amp;P 500 since 1928, according to Bespoke. The 25.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500 was the best for the period since 2013, and now the market enters a typically strong period.
*****
&gt; “December is the best month of the year. The S&amp;P is up 1.6 percent on average. It also has the highest frequency of advances, up 76% of the time,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. December is also the least volatile month of all, but it could see some bumps.
*****
&gt; “The market tends to go through a mid-December low, which then represents a good buying opportunity, at least through the end of January,” Stovall said, adding he thinks the decline would be no more than 5%. “I don’t think we need a big pullback or a correction. A mid-single digit decline would be sufficient.”
*****
&gt; Stovall said 2019 was set up to win because of the way the year started, following the sharp sell-off last December. When the months of January and February are higher, the S&amp;P 500 has an average total return of 24%, according to data going back to 1945. If the following year does not see have a similar double gain in January and February, it still does fairly well with a normal average return of 8% to 9%, he said.
*****
&gt; The market’s performance for the entire year also bodes well for a positive move into year-end, according to Bespoke. Since 1928, when stocks are up 20% or more by Thanksgiving, like this year, the S&amp;P 500 usually ends the year even higher, with an average gain of 1.8% between Black Friday and New Year’s Eve, Bespoke noted.
*****
&gt; # S&amp;P Sub-industry sector performance
&gt; Stovall also looked at sector performance for December, going back to 1995 and found that some of the worst performing S&amp;P sub-industry sectors were retail oriented and are highly dependent on good holiday sales. On average, computer and electronics retailers were weakest, off 4.5%, followed by leisure products off 2.2% and department stores, off 0.9%. Specialty stores and apparel and luxury goods were also among the 10 poorest performers.
*****
&gt; While 87% of the sub-industry sectors were positive, the top performer was homebuilding, up 4.5 %, followed by home improvement retail.
*****
&gt; “You want to buy now what nobody wants to own,” said Stovall, noting the market is forward pricing so investors are looking ahead to building activity picking up in spring and summer when they dip into homebuilders. Companies that sell fertilizers also do well in December.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Friday closed out their best monthly performance since June. The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.4% to 3,140, and the Dow closed Friday at 28,051, up 3.7% for the month of November.
*****
&gt; Technology was the best performing sector for the month, gaining 5.2%. That helped drive the Nasdaq up 4.5% for the month to 8,665.
*****
&gt; Biotech was also a top performer, helping lift the Russell 2000, which gained 4% in November to 1,624. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up 11% for the month.
*****
&gt; # Trade tensions
&gt; The big risk to the market in December is the outcome of trade talks, but economic reports will be important as investors continue to assess whether the Fed was right in ending its rate cuts.
*****
&gt; The economy has shown some signs of picking up, and a string of improved data has led economists to look for better growth in the fourth quarter. But the critical driver of growth continues to be the consumer, so holiday sales will be an important indicator to watch.
*****
&gt; Employment data remains the most important of the economic reports, since a strong labor market is crucial for consumer confidence and spending.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the economy added 183,000 jobs in November, according to Refinitiv. The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, even with the negative drag of 46,000 striking GM workers and the reduction of 17,000 federal government jobs, due to the end of temporary employment for Census workers.
*****
&gt; “For the employment report, we think one factor that is likely to result in a slightly stronger headline payroll number is the fact we will now count the GM workers that were on strike,” said Barclays economist Pooja Sriram. “We estimated 36,000 to 40,000 were left out of the report in October. We think they’re to be counted as part of the November report. Much of that is going to be seen in private payrolls and especially in manufacturing payrolls.”
*****
&gt; In October, ISM manufacturing activity improved, and even though it remained in contraction, some economists said the slowdown may be showing signs of bottoming.
*****
&gt; The ISM index is expected to be at 49.4, still shy of 50, which shows expansion, but better than October’s 48.3. “We still think it’s going to be a sub-50 print,” said Sriram.
*****
&gt; October’s durable goods report showed a surprise gain in business investment when economists had expected to see contraction.
*****
&gt; Sriram said the speed of decline in manufacturing has certainly slowed, and she is watching the data closely. “I don’t think we’re comfortable saying we bottomed,” she said.
*****
&gt; OPEC and Russia hold meetings in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, and analysts expect them to extend their production cutting agreement. However, Russia may seek to change the rules for how it counts its petroleum output, so the meeting may not be as predictable as expected, some analysts say.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/29/19

&gt; Even with a holiday and a shortened session Friday leaving no US releases in the past 48 hours, it was a very busy week for economic data with 36 releases in the first three days. Most of this data came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading where there were no forecasts. While the bulk of the week's data was strong, manufacturing data, namely from the regional Fed indices, was mixed. We started off with a weaker Chicago Fed National Activity Index on Monday. The index fell from -0.45 last month to -0.71 rather than the expected improvement to -0.2. The Dallas Fed's index was also out on Monday and it improved more than expected as well as versus the prior month. On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed's gauge on manufacturing was also worse than expected. On the bright side, other manufacturing hard data like durable goods came in much stronger than both the previous month and consensus forecasts. Housing data was also solid this week with better than anticipated home price growth shown in two of the three indicators: the quarterly Home Price Purchase Index, FHFA, and Case-Shiller (only the Case-Shiller index was weaker than expected, albeit up from the prior month). The second release of third-quarter GDP was the most notable indicator of the week with a much stronger than expected reading which showed the economy grew by 2.1% QoQ versus estimates of a 1.9% growth rate.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco1.png))**

&gt; We kick off December with another busy few days next week. Final November Markit and ISM numbers will kick off the week on Monday. While Markit is not expecting any change from the preliminary readings, ISM is expected to improve to 49.2 which would still be a contractionary print. In hard manufacturing data, later in the week we will see final durable and capital goods numbers for November. Vehicle sales figures will be the only release on Tuesday followed by the service counterparts to Markit and ISM indices on Wednesday as the rest of the week's main focus will be on labor data. After a surprisingly strong release last month, Nonfarm Payrolls is again expecting a strong print showing 190K jobs created in the month of November.

# Stocks To Be The Most Thankful For

&gt; Below is a list of the 25 best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tops the list with a gain of more than 100%. While no other S&amp;P 500 stocks have yet to double this year, another semi name, Lam Research (LRCX) has come close with a gain of 99%. Xerox (XRX), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Target (TGT) have also all risen more than 90%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-2.png))**

&gt; Apple (AAPL) is the 19th best performing stock in the list above. But because of its trillion+ dollar market cap, Apple's (AAPL) 69% gain has a much bigger impact on the overall stock market than all of the other stocks that have seen a bigger price move this year. In fact, of the S&amp;P 500's 25% price gain this year, Apple has accounted for 2.24 of those percentage points (or roughly 9%).

&gt; Instead of looking at simple year-to-date price change, below is a list of the stocks that investors should be most thankful for this year because of their contribution to the S&amp;P's gains. Right behind Apple (AAPL) in first is the other trillion+ dollar company -- Microsoft (MSFT) -- which has accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 25% gain. After AAPL and MSFT are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Together these five mega-caps account for 25% of the S&amp;P's move higher this year. While this group of companies has been vilified in 2019 for a number of things, they're certainly still delivering for the stock market in a big way.

# S&amp;P 500 Industry Group Breadth Running Strong

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 may be hitting record highs at a pace of more than once every other day, but would you believe that there are still Industry Groups trading below their 50-day moving averages? The chart below shows the rolling percentage of Industry Groups trading above their 50-DMAs over the last several years, and the current reading stands at 91.7%. Over the last five years there have been numerous periods where a higher percentage (and even 100%) of Industry Groups traded above their 50-DMAs, and the most recent was back in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA-Chart.png))**

&gt; So which are the two outlier groups that are still below their 50-DMAs? Well, when everyone seems to be taking an offensive posture in the market, it's only natural that defensive sectors would be lagging, and two of the most defensive-oriented sectors in this yield-hungry world we live in are Utilities and Real Estate. Even these two groups, though, are only about 1% below their 50-DMAs, so all it will take is one or two good days for these groups to get them back over the hump. On the upside, Health Care Equipment &amp; Services is the furthest above its 50-DMA at 7.72%.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is currently just over 4% above its 50-DMA. What's interesting to note here, though, is that just 9 of the 24 Industry Groups are further above their 50-DMAs while 15 are not above their 50-DMAs by as much as the S&amp;P 500. In terms of YTD returns, the S&amp;P 500 is currently sitting on a gain of more than 25% YTD. Leading the way higher this year, Tech Hardware (Apple) has rallied just under 48%, while Semis are up just over 40%. Behind these two leaders, four other Industry Groups are up over 30% YTD. While there is no downside on a YTD basis, Energy has been the biggest laggard and is just barely hanging on to a YTD gain. If Energy can't hang onto a YTD gain in a year where the S&amp;P 500 gains more than 25%, Energy investors may need to wear paper bags over their heads.

# Technology Sector P/E Highest in Ten Years

&gt; As equities run to all-time highs, valuations are at a fairly interesting point. As shown in the chart below using data from our Daily Sector Snapshot included with our Morning Lineup and The Closer, most sectors' valuations are at the upper end of the past ten years' range. Four sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Utilities, and Technology all have trailing P/E ratios in the 90th percentile or higher of the past ten years' readings.

&gt; Since the S&amp;P 500 established its first all-time high since July on October 28th, Health Care and Financials have been two of the strongest performers rising 6.68% and 4.35%, respectively. Despite these runs, both of these sectors still have reasonable valuations relative to the past decade. For Financials, the current trailing price-to-earnings ratio is in the 42nd percentile of all days of the past ten years. No other sector has such a low reading although Materials and Energy are on the lower end relative to other sectors. On the other hand, Utilities and Technology have some of the highest valuations of the past ten years with the current P/E in the 97th and 99th percentiles, respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/PE2.png))**

&gt; As shown in the chart below, most of the last 9-12 months has seen valuations for Utilities consistently in the uppermost range of the past ten years as investors chased yield in a low interest rate environment. But as risk-free rates have risen more recently, valuations for Utilities have pulled back a bit as price has slid. While there have been other periods in the past ten years where Utilities' P/E ratio was similarly elevated, arguably only 2016/2017 saw it remain at the upper end of the ten-year range as consistently as has been the case this year.

&gt; For Technology it is a whole different story. The P/E for the sector got crushed this time last year and after plummeting to the 31st percentile, it is has rebounded to the highest levels of the past ten years. The only other time that the sector traded at a similar premium relative to the past decade's range was back in early 2018.

# Thanksgiving through Santa Claus Rally Trade

&gt; Everyone is talking about yearend seasonal strength this year, but it’s not news to us. 2019 has been tracking historical seasonal market patterns quite closely this year and that suggests it is likely to continue to track it.

&gt; Our good friend Larry McMillan (@optstrategist) trades seasonal yearend strength with the Russell 2000 from the close the day before Thanksgiving through the end of our Santa Claus Rally (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year).

&gt; So here we have run the numbers from 1979 when the Russell index data begins comparing R2K to the DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. The small-cap index Russell 2000 is the best performer up an average 3.1% (median 3.2%) with an 80% win ratio up 32 of the last 40 years. Last year was the worst and it’s been down 3 of the last 5 years.

# Giving Thanks for the U.S. Consumer

&gt; This Thanksgiving, we’re thankful for solid consumer confidence, even though it has wavered in recent months.

&gt; Consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November, according to preliminary Conference Board data. Even though the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has dropped from its economic cycle peak, consumer sentiment is still historically elevated, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/consumer-confidence_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We’ve been pleasantly surprised by the U.S. consumer’s resilience over the past year as other parts of the domestic economy have weakened amid global headwinds. Strong consumer spending has helped the economy grow at a 2% average rate over the past two quarters, despite drags on growth from business spending, inventories, and trade.

&gt; “Consumer sentiment has been largely immune from global headwinds,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect consumer spending to power economic growth through next year, so we’d like to see consumer confidence pick up more with signs of trade progress.”

&gt; Consumers have several reasons to be optimistic. Employment is the primary driver of consumer health, and the U.S. labor market has been resilient. Wages are growing at a healthy rate, and consumers are reaping the benefits of tax cuts and record-high stock prices. As long as the job market stays solid and inflation remains in check, we feel good about consumers’ prospects.

&gt; Still, there are growing signs of concern. While survey respondents have remained optimistic about present conditions, their outlook on future conditions has soured, according to the Conference Board. If consumers are feeling less confident about the future, they may be less inclined to spend and invest. That loss of confidence in the outlook could lead to economic weakness over time if consumers step back.

&gt; Overall, we would need to see more significant deterioration in consumer confidence before we would start to worry about the economic outlook.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Saturday morning to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/wallstreetbets""&gt;r/wallstreetbets&lt;/a&gt;. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 2nd, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/december-could-be-good-for-the-stock-market-but-theres-one-big-risk.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks have had a bang-up year so far, and they’re heading straight into the month that is often the best of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is up more than 25% for the year. Thanksgiving week was technically positive for the market, with the small cap Russell 2000 breaking out, joining other indexes in an uptrend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks, however, were lower Friday in sluggish trading after the Thanksgiving holiday. Through Wednesday, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;amp;P 500 had all popped to new record highs, with consumer discretionary and tech names leading the market higher this past week. The Russell 2000 is not yet back to its highs, but it pushed above its previous 52-week high, in a healthy sign for the overall market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming week, investor focus will move more intently to the topic of trade, and that is what will make or break the rally at year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has promised that a preliminary trade deal with China is close, but there still is no agreement and the Dec.15 deadline for new tariffs is getting closer. Trump’s signing of legislation Wednesday supporting the Hong Kong protesters drew a negative reaction from Beijing and adds more uncertainty to trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health of the economy is also a factor for markets, and there is some key data, with the ISM manufacturing report on Monday followed by the government’s all-important monthly jobs data on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Best month of year&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 has turned out to be a very good year for the market, with the Jan. 1 to Thanksgiving Day period the 14th best for the S&amp;amp;P 500 since 1928, according to Bespoke. The 25.5% gain in the S&amp;amp;P 500 was the best for the period since 2013, and now the market enters a typically strong period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“December is the best month of the year. The S&amp;amp;P is up 1.6 percent on average. It also has the highest frequency of advances, up 76% of the time,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. December is also the least volatile month of all, but it could see some bumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The market tends to go through a mid-December low, which then represents a good buying opportunity, at least through the end of January,” Stovall said, adding he thinks the decline would be no more than 5%. “I don’t think we need a big pullback or a correction. A mid-single digit decline would be sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stovall said 2019 was set up to win because of the way the year started, following the sharp sell-off last December. When the months of January and February are higher, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has an average total return of 24%, according to data going back to 1945. If the following year does not see have a similar double gain in January and February, it still does fairly well with a normal average return of 8% to 9%, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market’s performance for the entire year also bodes well for a positive move into year-end, according to Bespoke. Since 1928, when stocks are up 20% or more by Thanksgiving, like this year, the S&amp;amp;P 500 usually ends the year even higher, with an average gain of 1.8% between Black Friday and New Year’s Eve, Bespoke noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;S&amp;amp;P Sub-industry sector performance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stovall also looked at sector performance for December, going back to 1995 and found that some of the worst performing S&amp;amp;P sub-industry sectors were retail oriented and are highly dependent on good holiday sales. On average, computer and electronics retailers were weakest, off 4.5%, followed by leisure products off 2.2% and department stores, off 0.9%. Specialty stores and apparel and luxury goods were also among the 10 poorest performers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 87% of the sub-industry sectors were positive, the top performer was homebuilding, up 4.5 %, followed by home improvement retail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You want to buy now what nobody wants to own,” said Stovall, noting the market is forward pricing so investors are looking ahead to building activity picking up in spring and summer when they dip into homebuilders. Companies that sell fertilizers also do well in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks on Friday closed out their best monthly performance since June. The S&amp;amp;P 500 was up 3.4% to 3,140, and the Dow closed Friday at 28,051, up 3.7% for the month of November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology was the best performing sector for the month, gaining 5.2%. That helped drive the Nasdaq up 4.5% for the month to 8,665.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biotech was also a top performer, helping lift the Russell 2000, which gained 4% in November to 1,624. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up 11% for the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Trade tensions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big risk to the market in December is the outcome of trade talks, but economic reports will be important as investors continue to assess whether the Fed was right in ending its rate cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economy has shown some signs of picking up, and a string of improved data has led economists to look for better growth in the fourth quarter. But the critical driver of growth continues to be the consumer, so holiday sales will be an important indicator to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment data remains the most important of the economic reports, since a strong labor market is crucial for consumer confidence and spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists expect the economy added 183,000 jobs in November, according to Refinitiv. The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, even with the negative drag of 46,000 striking GM workers and the reduction of 17,000 federal government jobs, due to the end of temporary employment for Census workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the employment report, we think one factor that is likely to result in a slightly stronger headline payroll number is the fact we will now count the GM workers that were on strike,” said Barclays economist Pooja Sriram. “We estimated 36,000 to 40,000 were left out of the report in October. We think they’re to be counted as part of the November report. Much of that is going to be seen in private payrolls and especially in manufacturing payrolls.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, ISM manufacturing activity improved, and even though it remained in contraction, some economists said the slowdown may be showing signs of bottoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISM index is expected to be at 49.4, still shy of 50, which shows expansion, but better than October’s 48.3. “We still think it’s going to be a sub-50 print,” said Sriram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October’s durable goods report showed a surprise gain in business investment when economists had expected to see contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sriram said the speed of decline in manufacturing has certainly slowed, and she is watching the data closely. “I don’t think we’re comfortable saying we bottomed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPEC and Russia hold meetings in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, and analysts expect them to extend their production cutting agreement. However, Russia may seek to change the rules for how it counts its petroleum output, so the meeting may not be as predictable as expected, some analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Next Week&amp;#39;s Economic Indicators - 11/29/19&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with a holiday and a shortened session Friday leaving no US releases in the past 48 hours, it was a very busy week for economic data with 36 releases in the first three days. Most of this data came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading where there were no forecasts. While the bulk of the week&amp;#39;s data was strong, manufacturing data, namely from the regional Fed indices, was mixed. We started off with a weaker Chicago Fed National Activity Index on Monday. The index fell from -0.45 last month to -0.71 rather than the expected improvement to -0.2. The Dallas Fed&amp;#39;s index was also out on Monday and it improved more than expected as well as versus the prior month. On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed&amp;#39;s gauge on manufacturing was also worse than expected. On the bright side, other manufacturing hard data like durable goods came in much stronger than both the previous month and consensus forecasts. Housing data was also solid this week with better than anticipated home price growth shown in two of the three indicators: the quarterly Home Price Purchase Index, FHFA, and Case-Shiller (only the Case-Shiller index was weaker than expected, albeit up from the prior month). The second release of third-quarter GDP was the most notable indicator of the week with a much stronger than expected reading which showed the economy grew by 2.1% QoQ versus estimates of a 1.9% growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kick off December with another busy few days next week. Final November Markit and ISM numbers will kick off the week on Monday. While Markit is not expecting any change from the preliminary readings, ISM is expected to improve to 49.2 which would still be a contractionary print. In hard manufacturing data, later in the week we will see final durable and capital goods numbers for November. Vehicle sales figures will be the only release on Tuesday followed by the service counterparts to Markit and ISM indices on Wednesday as the rest of the week&amp;#39;s main focus will be on labor data. After a surprisingly strong release last month, Nonfarm Payrolls is again expecting a strong print showing 190K jobs created in the month of November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stocks To Be The Most Thankful For&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of the 25 best performing stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 so far in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tops the list with a gain of more than 100%. While no other S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks have yet to double this year, another semi name, Lam Research (LRCX) has come close with a gain of 99%. Xerox (XRX), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Target (TGT) have also all risen more than 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-2.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL) is the 19th best performing stock in the list above. But because of its trillion+ dollar market cap, Apple&amp;#39;s (AAPL) 69% gain has a much bigger impact on the overall stock market than all of the other stocks that have seen a bigger price move this year. In fact, of the S&amp;amp;P 500&amp;#39;s 25% price gain this year, Apple has accounted for 2.24 of those percentage points (or roughly 9%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at simple year-to-date price change, below is a list of the stocks that investors should be most thankful for this year because of their contribution to the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s gains. Right behind Apple (AAPL) in first is the other trillion+ dollar company -- Microsoft (MSFT) -- which has accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s 25% gain. After AAPL and MSFT are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Together these five mega-caps account for 25% of the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s move higher this year. While this group of companies has been vilified in 2019 for a number of things, they&amp;#39;re certainly still delivering for the stock market in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Industry Group Breadth Running Strong&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 may be hitting record highs at a pace of more than once every other day, but would you believe that there are still Industry Groups trading below their 50-day moving averages? The chart below shows the rolling percentage of Industry Groups trading above their 50-DMAs over the last several years, and the current reading stands at 91.7%. Over the last five years there have been numerous periods where a higher percentage (and even 100%) of Industry Groups traded above their 50-DMAs, and the most recent was back in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA-Chart.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So which are the two outlier groups that are still below their 50-DMAs? Well, when everyone seems to be taking an offensive posture in the market, it&amp;#39;s only natural that defensive sectors would be lagging, and two of the most defensive-oriented sectors in this yield-hungry world we live in are Utilities and Real Estate. Even these two groups, though, are only about 1% below their 50-DMAs, so all it will take is one or two good days for these groups to get them back over the hump. On the upside, Health Care Equipment &amp;amp; Services is the furthest above its 50-DMA at 7.72%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 as a whole is currently just over 4% above its 50-DMA. What&amp;#39;s interesting to note here, though, is that just 9 of the 24 Industry Groups are further above their 50-DMAs while 15 are not above their 50-DMAs by as much as the S&amp;amp;P 500. In terms of YTD returns, the S&amp;amp;P 500 is currently sitting on a gain of more than 25% YTD. Leading the way higher this year, Tech Hardware (Apple) has rallied just under 48%, while Semis are up just over 40%. Behind these two leaders, four other Industry Groups are up over 30% YTD. While there is no downside on a YTD basis, Energy has been the biggest laggard and is just barely hanging on to a YTD gain. If Energy can&amp;#39;t hang onto a YTD gain in a year where the S&amp;amp;P 500 gains more than 25%, Energy investors may need to wear paper bags over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Technology Sector P/E Highest in Ten Years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As equities run to all-time highs, valuations are at a fairly interesting point. As shown in the chart below using data from our Daily Sector Snapshot included with our Morning Lineup and The Closer, most sectors&amp;#39; valuations are at the upper end of the past ten years&amp;#39; range. Four sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Utilities, and Technology all have trailing P/E ratios in the 90th percentile or higher of the past ten years&amp;#39; readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the S&amp;amp;P 500 established its first all-time high since July on October 28th, Health Care and Financials have been two of the strongest performers rising 6.68% and 4.35%, respectively. Despite these runs, both of these sectors still have reasonable valuations relative to the past decade. For Financials, the current trailing price-to-earnings ratio is in the 42nd percentile of all days of the past ten years. No other sector has such a low reading although Materials and Energy are on the lower end relative to other sectors. On the other hand, Utilities and Technology have some of the highest valuations of the past ten years with the current P/E in the 97th and 99th percentiles, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the chart below, most of the last 9-12 months has seen valuations for Utilities consistently in the uppermost range of the past ten years as investors chased yield in a low interest rate environment. But as risk-free rates have risen more recently, valuations for Utilities have pulled back a bit as price has slid. While there have been other periods in the past ten years where Utilities&amp;#39; P/E ratio was similarly elevated, arguably only 2016/2017 saw it remain at the upper end of the ten-year range as consistently as has been the case this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Technology it is a whole different story. The P/E for the sector got crushed this time last year and after plummeting to the 31st percentile, it is has rebounded to the highest levels of the past ten years. The only other time that the sector traded at a similar premium relative to the past decade&amp;#39;s range was back in early 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Thanksgiving through Santa Claus Rally Trade&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is talking about yearend seasonal strength this year, but it’s not news to us. 2019 has been tracking historical seasonal market patterns quite closely this year and that suggests it is likely to continue to track it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our good friend Larry McMillan (@optstrategist) trades seasonal yearend strength with the Russell 2000 from the close the day before Thanksgiving through the end of our Santa Claus Rally (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we have run the numbers from 1979 when the Russell index data begins comparing R2K to the DJIA, S&amp;amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. The small-cap index Russell 2000 is the best performer up an average 3.1% (median 3.2%) with an 80% win ratio up 32 of the last 40 years. Last year was the worst and it’s been down 3 of the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Giving Thanks for the U.S. Consumer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Thanksgiving, we’re thankful for solid consumer confidence, even though it has wavered in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November, according to preliminary Conference Board data. Even though the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has dropped from its economic cycle peak, consumer sentiment is still historically elevated, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/consumer-confidence_1.png?ssl=1""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been pleasantly surprised by the U.S. consumer’s resilience over the past year as other parts of the domestic economy have weakened amid global headwinds. Strong consumer spending has helped the economy grow at a 2% average rate over the past two quarters, despite drags on growth from business spending, inventories, and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Consumer sentiment has been largely immune from global headwinds,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect consumer spending to power economic growth through next year, so we’d like to see consumer confidence pick up more with signs of trade progress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers have several reasons to be optimistic. Employment is the primary driver of consumer health, and the U.S. labor market has been resilient. Wages are growing at a healthy rate, and consumers are reaping the benefits of tax cuts and record-high stock prices. As long as the job market stays solid and inflation remains in check, we feel good about consumers’ prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are growing signs of concern. While survey respondents have remained optimistic about present conditions, their outlook on future conditions has soured, according to the Conference Board. If consumers are feeling less confident about the future, they may be less inclined to spend and invest. That loss of confidence in the outlook could lead to economic weakness over time if consumers step back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, we would need to see more significant deterioration in consumer confidence before we would start to worry about the economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

The Fed’s interventions are aimed at ensuring that the financial system has enough liquidity and that short- term borrowing rates remain well-behaved, with the central bank’s federal-funds rate staying within the 1.5%-to-1.75% target range. The effective fed-funds rate stood at 1.55% on Tuesday. The broad general collateral rate for repo trading stood at 1.51%, also for Tuesday.

Since the large interventions started, money-market rates have been well-behaved. The Fed is using temporary operations to tamp down on any possible volatility, while purchasing Treasury bills to build up reserves in the banking system. It hopes that by buying Treasury bills it will be able to cut back on repo interventions at the start of next year.

The Fed currently expects to buy Treasury bills through the middle of next year.

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Bank of New York added $108.95 billion in temporary liquidity to the financial system on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intervention came in two parts. There were $87.95 billion in overnight repurchase agreements, or repos, and $21 billion in 15-day repos. The central bank took all the securities it was offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fed repo interventions take in Treasury and mortgage securities from eligible banks in what is effectively a short-term loan of central-bank cash, collateralized by the securities.

The reason I think it is a worthy WSB trade is it will pay out $9 if three of the late stage drugs Celgene had in trials are approved by about 2021.   It is a all or nothing trade, all three have to get approved.   So $20,900 turns into $90,000, a worthy YOLO imo.

What ideas do you have on this?

Here are mine:

Folder feature: Allow user to group a bunch of positions in a 'folder'. This way I can put my distant options / dividend paying safe stock in folders so i can focus on my week to week BS. Folder would display value of contents each day.
For example, I have to scroll past my CRON, CGC, PFE long positions that I'm not touching to find my SPY puts and weekly calls.



Dividend notification: when you receive dividends/coupons, display a treasure chest that the user clicks on and have the money jump out. This way you see your dividends happen. (Actual money is received in the normal way, the notification is just cooler)

Achievements: Add achievements for various things like getting 100, 200, 300, 1000 % gains also for owning various types of positions or executiing different trades. This will encourage people to learn about different kinds of cool things, like buying up BB- bonds. This way you can have a score (I have a ton of cool ideas for the achievements and would love to work with any brokerage that wants to consult with me on this idea)

FD YOLO Button: have automatic YOLO button where you enter a dollar amount, and your PRT, and it automatically buys liquid OTM options on something with an upcoming event expiring very soon within your stated PRT. (For example, if you have a $300 you can place a trade with a chance of getting $600 or zero w/o knowing the underlying stock)

Exercise button: Have a button/right click on options to excercize them.

Personal Loans: allow users to loan other users money and track defaults within app.

Automatic anti-retardation feature: allow users to lock themselves out of certain stocks for certain amounts of time to prevent doubling down on shitty stocks.

Have a weighted indicator of who is buying what:
Basically, using your annual returns, assign each user a score as to their Skills and PRT (sorta like a sharpe ratio) then if a bunch of people are buying a stock, lets us see if those people are autists who lose money or smart people who make money, this way we can follow the money makers.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I&amp;#39;ve been doing options for a while now, and I&amp;#39;ve thought of some features I would want Brokerages like Fidelity, Robinhood and Robinhood added.

I just discovered this GEM of a stock a few days ago.  It wasn't on my radar as it has very low volume which wouldn't trip on my scanner.  The way I came about it was because I had to go shopping for shoes and a friend recommended Shoe Carnival to me.  Now, I had heard of the company before but never really shopped there and didn't even know it was a public company.  I ended up getting a pair of sneakers there for dirt cheap but that wasn't what interested me.

I went back home and was curious so I dug up some info on the company and realized it was  traded.  Being an non-autistic WSBer, I researched the shit out of it the last few days and come to the conclusion that this is a MONSTER squeeze candidate in the making.  Just look at the numbers above.

With OVER 50% of the available shares shorted, and an extremely low float (only 9.1 million shares available), any major purchase of even a thousand shares is enough to move it like crazy.  The bid-ask spread on this the last few days is usually 0.5% or more because of such low liquidity.  This tells me that MM's and brokers won't be holding alot of this stock making gigantic moves more likely (ie. don't do market buys/sells!).  The last few trading days, the volume that is SHORT is above 10% of the total volume which has been steady.  This tells me that there is still a decent amount of short interest here (likely averaging UP) from existing shorts.

The earnings themselves beat AND raised.  The after hours movement the stock touched $40 but the day after it dropped back down (many factors, $FL reported earnings the morning which disappointed so sympathetic drop, more shorts piling on averaging UP to play a rip-bounce reversal).  The stock has seen a temporary rip generally in the mornings of 1-5% after the earnings only to reverse it all.  It's been holding steady as I believe it looks to be accumulation.  The company also has a buyback program with $19.1 million left on the books.  If they were to buy it all back today, it will reduce the float even more (another 500K shares).

On their latest earnings conference call, they mention they are well-insulated from tariffs as the majority of their inventory comes from Viet Nam which means no Trump-China BS affecting them (other than weak bagholders causing price to drop on selling).

Shoes may not interest the common WSB.  But given the numbers shown above, I can see this gapping slowly towards $50 in the next few weeks.  This suggests a potential 30% gain in the next month on a relatively safe bet.  Be warned though, that because of the low float, the daily movements in this stock may be stomach churning so my advice would be to buy it, forget it.  Hell, even set up some buy limit orders that is 1-2% below the price and you may be surprised that you can pick it up on random stop loss picking dips.

I'm personally in this one at an average of 35.88 @ 3400 shares.  I have firepower capital to buy another 4600 shares on dips.  I will be holding and selling at $50 if it hits.  I might sell 34 contracts of covered calls at either $40 or $45 for the Dec 20 monthly to protect myself a bit in case it has a random intraday dip, in which case I buy back the calls for a small discount.  Usually, the intraday dip corrects itself quickly and I will probably sell the same number of calls again.  Profiting on both dips and rips.

UPDATE: Checked the insider transactions.  Only 3 sells for all of 2019 for a total of $1 million USD.  Checked the job postings, over 3800 positions meaning they can handle that many more employee expenses.

UPDATE 2 (11/29): I pretty much called that dip didn't I ;)  And it pretty much corrected itself eh?  Hope the non-autists listened to me and got in on that dip.  Heck, you can even flip it for a nice 1-2% if you want.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCVL: SHOE CARNIVAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The users sold calls with very low strike price that were in the money. When you sell such a low strike call, you are essentially selling the security at market price.

Anyway last week i was in New York on the wallstreet. I wanted to take a pic with the charging bull but it was overwhelmed with asian tourists so I got mad and ordered an Uber.

The fare was $84, fine for the distance I was doing. Then the day after they had charged me with an ""adjusted my fare"" and pulled another $16 (how is that even legal) without a god damn notification, first warning sign. Then I click on the receipt because I was curious as to the specification to the $16.62 specific amount. The  receipt said ONLY:

In addition to other government-mandated taxes and fees, you'll also notice a new Congestion Surcharge on Manhattan trips below 96th St.

First thing, that's unfair as fuck. They knew the initiary before I booked which their algos could calculate into the price they offered even before i booked it. Secondly, where the fuck is the detailing of the specific 16 bucks u just nicked from my man purse??? Just that drives me nuts.

I kept searching for a reasoning for a (to me) huge difference in final price, people were like fees, tolls, traffic but all those were baked in into the first fee i paid with the $84 fare. So I was really curious how they calculated it so I contested the change and demanded a detailing of the fees (IT WASN'T EVEN DETAILED ON THE GOD DAMN RECEIPT HOW ILLEGAL ISN'T THAT).

Anyway, 3 hours later i get an answer. Guess what? A refund for $18, without any form of specification on the error (this to me is the last final warning sign).

And you ask me what are the warning signs leading up to? Well, that they do this intentionally. Unsuspecting customers or people that take this at face value: ""In addition to other government-mandated taxes and fees, you'll also notice a new Congestion Surcharge on Manhattan trips below 96th St."".

So this leads me to the numbers. They increased my fare by approx 20%. Say they use this technique on 1% of their users. And 30% of the users they pull this on suspect them and get refunded. This leads to the fact that their revenue is exaggerated by a crazy 0.001%. Knowing growth stocks are based on revenue growth that is unacceptable and I'm setting a price target at $0,2 per share.

Disney released Disney+ and Frozen these past few weeks and the earnings that came with them reflected only the costs and the hype that came with the releases. 

The coming year will see major revenue growth from the streaming app and an increase in the streaming library size. Bringing many who haven’t yet bought Disney+ into the Disney fold.

Some support for the growing Disney brand is the park operation. I’m currently at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, FL and was at Universal Studio yesterday. Both parks (and I’m assuming EPCOT as well) are undergoing expansion/construction in their resort areas probably to accommodate an increase in park attendance. Not only this, but Disney has opened its newest theme park expansion Star Wars: Galaxies Edge which has yet to prove its profit generation. Coupled with Disney’s series The Mandalorian, the show will very likely drive up park attendance at the new theme park.

All in all, 2020 will prove to be a massive year for Disney’s parks and it’s streaming service. If you haven’t bought in a dip yet, do so before the next earnings because it will most definitely be big. If not, that will be due to construction costs at the parks and will be the centrally planned dip to make good earnings nonconsecutive and generate larger positive shifts in price.

Anyways, that’s been my Thanksgiving DD, enjoy the holidays and don’t stop betting on wallstreet, my fellow autists.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just some light dd reading for your holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been studying the wildlife of wallstreetbets for a number of years. The sophistication is near zero save for a few of the critters that inhabit this desolate land. It’s incredibly cutthroat and for those that do survive the initial shock still get beaten down by the more senior wildlife.

Our primary groups are split up into three separate but very similar factions: Bear, Bull, and Theta Gang. 

Bear gang is almost always asleep. When the overall landscape gets a little uncomfortable they awake for a few minutes, only to go back into hybernation for a few more decades. 

When they do awake, they let out a terrible scream that sounds something like “SPY puts because I’m a filthy commie” or “I have bearish DD on AAPL and MSFT”, but these bears are short lived and typically get slaughtered after awakening,

Bull gang, the overly optimistic and always awake. Bull gang herds are much larger than bear gang herds. This is partially due to the fact bulls will typically go with the flow and not overcomplicate life. If the harvest is strong, bull gang is in. Bull gang is simple yet much more successful than bears.

Theta gang. 

The most hated yet most respected gang on this degenerate plane. Unlike the simple bulls and bears, theta gang takes no form. Theta gang exists simply because the universe exists. While the bulls and bears have relatively short lifespans theta gang is eternal. 

Theta gang thrives on the minimalist approach. As long as time passes, then theta gang is alive,

Day trade gang:

They swing their 25k+ around like it’s nothing. They enter and exit trades that bear and bull gang can only dream of.

Technical analysis gang:

Horoscopes

So I ended up reading all of the articles in regards to Lumateperone's usage for treating schizophrenia. It seems like Lumateperone has a very good dopamine d2 receptor occupancy level (rivals that of Clozapine, one of the best anti-psychotic drugs on the market) and the 60 mg oral daily dose has shown efficacy in two of the three randomized phase 3 trials. After finishing up the phase 3 studies, the FDA canceled the Adcom on Lumateperone's candidacy for schizophrenia and simply asked the company for animal toxicology studies. As it turns out, the molecule has an impeccable safety profile (it was optimized by med chemists at BMS) and these animal tox studies further supported that. But because Wall Street is obsessed with how adcom meetings can lead to stocks running high, a cancellation of an adcom was a bad sign for them and the stock got punished. Since the molecule had subpar performance in the previous phase 3 studies for its efficacy for treating bipolar disorder, I think that people were simply tired of this stock and thought it wasnt gonna go anywhere.

In my opinion, the FDA is very busy with packing all these meetings into its calendar and they realized that Lumateperone has an excellent safety profile and decided to simply ask for some supplemental information as opposed to having a whole meeting about the drug's safety. While the molecule did not show much efficacy in previous phase 3 studies, it seems like it actually has good performance against schizophrenia. Given that Karuna just got some great price boost from its phase 2 results, I think the market may react nicely to this potential approval.

From an insider perspective, there hasnt been any recent insider selling. There's a director that has bought over 6 million dollars worth of shares recently, and ITCI has been hiring a lot recently. Most of the people that were hired started working at October of 2019, interestingly. All of those who were hired are in the business/sales/growth of the company, showing that the company is anticipating an approval and is trying to set up a platform for growing their product.

There's quite a lot of short interest on this stock, and I believe that this is due to people thinking that this approval is gonna get rejected much like all the other previous approvals in regards to ITCI's Lumateperone. I have  calls on this, but to cover the premiums on them, I bought some puts on the off chance that the approval doesn't go through. Thus, my worst case scenario is that I won't lose any money, but if the drug does get approved, we might see a huge gain since market reacted quite nicely to Karuna recently. This is my DD on ITCI.

If there's one thing that buying options and playing around with individual stocks has taught me, it's that 1. I'm fundamentally retarded / 2. Predicting the future is a retard's game.

On the one hand, you have all these /investing and Boggleheads and even some folks on /wsb saying, ""if you have a 30 year horizon, just hold like you hold your penis while typing comments on pornhub.""

On the other, other hand, you have the 1970s 'n shit, or Japan since the early 90s, which went sideways for decades...shouldn't we at least do SOMETHING active to prevent loss?  Why the fuck is everything ""if you don't hold, you're an idiot.""  How the fuck do people know that ETFs are going to historically go up just because they went up in the past?  They don't!

So...yeah - maybe withdrawing a shitload into cash as shit gets hotter and hotter makes sense, right?  Like for every point above a decided mean...maybe withdraw a set amount in anticipation of being able to buy a dip at some point?  That way you're more exposed for potential upside for longer, but you're not 100% exposed.

Or...just some kind of stop loss sell?  Sell a portion if/when the market goes down by X% in 2020?

Just holding onto a general market ETF feels really retarded when it's generally accepted that things will go down a large amount at some point in the next let's say...year or maybe at least three years?

I come here asking this because literally any other investing forum would probably say, ""just hold it, bro.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those out there who are super old / geriatric, like 29 and above, and possibly might have non-gambling investing going on but maybe don&amp;#39;t want to admit it on here...is there anything you might be doing to combat against a potential huge crash coming up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s one thing that buying options and playing around with individual stocks has taught me, it&amp;#39;s that 1. I&amp;#39;m fundamentally retarded / 2. Predicting the future is a retard&amp;#39;s game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, you have all these /investing and Boggleheads and even some folks on /wsb saying, &amp;quot;if you have a 30 year horizon, just hold like you hold your penis while typing comments on pornhub.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other, other hand, you have the 1970s &amp;#39;n shit, or Japan since the early 90s, which went sideways for decades...shouldn&amp;#39;t we at least do SOMETHING active to prevent loss?  Why the fuck is everything &amp;quot;if you don&amp;#39;t hold, you&amp;#39;re an idiot.&amp;quot;  How the fuck do people know that ETFs are going to historically go up just because they went up in the past?  They don&amp;#39;t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So...yeah - maybe withdrawing a shitload into cash as shit gets hotter and hotter makes sense, right?  Like for every point above a decided mean...maybe withdraw a set amount in anticipation of being able to buy a dip at some point?  That way you&amp;#39;re more exposed for potential upside for longer, but you&amp;#39;re not 100% exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

I first started my trading journey around 16 months ago. I took out a loan and had an initial capital of 800 dollars, had absolutely no previous experience and started with Robinhood. Within a month I had around 30k dollars and was pretty damn happy. Afterwards things started going downhill after I tried messing with SNAP options and it definitely took me awhile to get back my edge.

At this point, I finally feel confident that I've got what it takes. I've learned the basics, developed my instincts, have a game plan when I open a trade, basically, I got my shit together. I've taken a couple months break to also reflect on any mistakes I might have been making.

So that's why I'm making this little bet with WSB, the bet is I will be able to make 100 Milion dollars in one year (or less) from the date of this post. If I win this bet, the first 50 people who comment on this post will get 500 bucks. If I lose, then I'll do something embarrassing, not sure what yet ( suggestions from  u/stormwillpass  are welcome).

P.S: I know the chances of this happening aren't huge but I (like many of you) believe I am **the one** who will succeed where so many have failed.

Edit: Due to the (somewhat unexpected) support, positivity and overall wholesomeness I'm changing this to if I win, the first 100 people to comment get 500 bucks. You guys rock.

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on taking the emotion out of trading?&lt;/p&gt;

Background: I am the lead hedge fund manager at the local Denny's

While analyzing ford I Realized that Ford's stock price has relative sell-offs at consolidated places. If you open up the MACD and a 1-month chart you can see the pattern and trend. The volume sold is also much higher than expected. Ive noticed these trends happen over a week frame so lets say you time the MACD and oscillator and buy Ford stock at $8.50. you wait 6 days and see that the MACD is showing bearish signs so you sell against for $9. You've just made $.50 a share. 

If you were to invest $100 into this you would have a quick 5% gain in a week. I tested my theory out yesterday Bought at $8.83 and sold at $9.05 today.

This is Vlad Tenev, for those who aren't aware. He looks like he just got out of a bong-ripping competition at the local dispensary and sells extra-strength edibles to your local high school freshmen. 2 things occurred to me as I found out what this dude actually looks like:

1. It's highly likely he has no idea wtf he's doing.
2. You're a literal retard if you trust this half-baked manchild to safeguard your money.

Also, I have this sneaking suspicion his Indian partner Baiju Bhatt likely did most of the programming for the platform. But even he looks like he just spent 3 weeks straight tripping balls on a volkswagon van somewhere in middle America.

However, this is something you do not want to do; you are better off just selling the calls. You will see this if you just calculate the profit between selling the call versus exercising and selling the stock. I thought I'd illustrate why.

Start with put-call parity:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put%E2%80%93call_parity

- C = price of call
- P = price of put
- S = market price of the stock
- X = strike price of the option
- PV(X) = present value of the strike price of the option

P + S = C + PV(X)

Re-arrange to solve for the price of a call:

C = P + S - PV(X)

Now, you can look at intrinsic value of the option; this is the value you get from exercising and selling the stock; this is the difference between buying the stock at the strike price and selling it at the market price (i.e. S-X). To add that to the expression above, we can both add and subtract X (to keep the equation balanced):

C = (S-X) + P + [X - PV(X)]

The first term (S-X) represents the intrinsic value. This is all you would get from exercising the call and selling the stock. However, as you can see, the actual option has additional value.

You get value from the built in downside protection - the value of the put (P). In addition, you get additional value from the interest you save by buying a call and deferring your purchase of stock into the future instead of purchasing the stock now [X - PV(X)].

TLDR: You should not exercise a call option early because of the value remaining from the built in downside protection and value of the interest savings. If you want to exit the position and don't want to hold until maturity, you are better off just selling the option. This is a good tool to help you determine what you should buy/sell your options for:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C = price of call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P = price of put&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S = market price of the stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X = strike price of the option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PV(X) = present value of the strike price of the option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P + S = C + PV(X)&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a good story. I’ve been watching $UNIT for half a year now since someone else posted a trade about it. I’ve continually bought into this stock as it goes lower and lower and lower and I think that, after my countless attempts to catch a falling knife, it’s finally bottomed out.

Uniti group is a REIT that constructs and acquires communications infrastructure through fiber, towers and leasing. They are a spin-off of Windstream Holdings. 

In order to understand what’s going on I have to start with who Windstream is. Windstream [is a provider of voice and data network communications](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windstream_Holdings) in predominantly rural areas. Windstream was and is a growing and profitable business. In 2015, Windstream decided to create a spin-off REIT in a move that would allow them to [reduce more than $4 billion in debt and increase network investments](https://investor.uniti.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windstream-board-directors-gives-final-approval-reit-spinoff-and). This was a pretty good move on their part as it freed up capital to continue making network investments and gave Windstream share holders a quarterly .25 cent dividend. It also allowed Uniti (then CS&amp;L) to operate as an independent company. This was also good for the newly formed Uniti as some of the sale-leasebacks [have almost 100% margins](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/05/09/uniti-group-inc-unit-q1-2019-earnings-call-transcr.aspx). This is all good and well for except for two things: One, Uniti’s income now was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified and two, this spin-off [tripped bond indentures](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-loses-legal-case-against-hedge-fund-aurelius-and-now-is-stuck-with-a-huge-bill-51550318739) meaning Windstream was now in default of issued bonds. This wasn’t an issue with most bond holders as they would be happy getting paid out when the bonds matured. Enter Aurelius Capital Management.

Aurelius Capital Management is a hedge fund operated by Mark Brodsky, a former bankruptcy lawyer. This is a ruthless man who is driven solely by profit and money and I’ll be goddamned if that’s not the way God intended things to be. This is the same man who [attempted to force the government of Argentina to pay 1.3 Billion following the 2010 Argentinian default on debt.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-01-14/aurelius-capital-sues-argentina-over-gdp-linked-securities). They’re vultures, gotta respect the hustle. Anyway, in 2017, a couple years after the Windstream/Unit spin-off, Aurelius buys up 25% of Windstream’s 2023 Bonds, then hits up the local CDS (Credit Default Swap, yes like The Big Short) market and gets a handful of those. The CDS will pay out if Windstream ever misses a payment on its debt. Then they walk back over to Windstream and say hey, your spin-off of assets violated bond covenants and we want to accelerate the payments of these notes. You owe us full repayment plus interest, approximately 310 Million. Windstream, being the reasonable company they are, say hey we can’t pay that, we don’t have the capital for that, that will bankrupt us. Plus, we didn’t violate bond covenants. Windstream is pretty confident that they didn’t violate bond covenants but just in case, they issue more notes in order to dilute Aurelius’s bond holdings down to 6.25% of the 2023’s, they try and retroactively get waivers from other bond holders and they visit **TWO** different law firms, both which say, Nah, you’re good bruh. You didn’t violate bond covenants. Subsequently, the stock price that had fallen to $2 per share rises to $7 per share over the course of the next few months. The Aurelius lawsuit was within the market's Personal Risk Tolerance. 

On February 25th, 2019, Judge Jesse Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rules that Windstream did, in fact, violate bond covenants when it spun off its fiber-optic cable business into Uniti. This caught everyone by surprise except Bid Dick Aurelius who is now awarded 310.5 Million and *will get paid out by the CDS it had*. What happened next is pretty brutal. Windstream immediately filed for a chapter 11 bankruptcy, watched its stock become a penny stock and has top executives [claiming market manipulation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-files-for-bankruptcy-calls-for-credit-default-swap-regulation-51551133206). To which Aurelius responds, and I quote, “Windstream’s accusation of market manipulation is nonsense,” says an Aurelius spokesperson. “Rather than whining about us and Judge Furman, Windstream’s management and board should engage in much-needed introspection.” Basically, suck it up pussies.

You’re probably wondering how this relates to Unit by now. Well, remember when I told you that Uniti’s revenue was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified? Well, they didn’t diversify quick enough. Windstream still accounts for 64% of Uniti’s revenue, which means when the ruling went against Windstream, Uniti’s stock price went down with it. To make matters worse, Windstream is looking to recharacterize a $650 million-per-year lease agreement with spinoff REIT Uniti Group Inc. as a disguised financing arrangement that siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars away from them. They’re saying that the lease was never actually a lease but a financing deal. They’re trying to claw back millions in payments in order to free up cash flow and get billions back in assets which are no longer theirs. This claim is artificially holding down Uniti’s stock price, as a ruling for Windstream could mean Uniti loses $650 million per year in the lease revenue. Here’s where we finally get to the trade. I believe that Uniti and Windstream will never even get to the court date that’s planned in March of 2020. Today, November 25th, a [summary of judgement](http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000010) was entered along with the supporting [memorandum of law](http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000011). This essentially holds Uniti’s lawyers’ arguments about dismissing Windstream’s ridiculous attempt to recharacterize the lease as financing. It has compelling arguments and since I know you won’t read it, I’ll try and summarize the strongest argument.

In order for Windstream to spin Unit into a REIT and gain the tax-advantage status while also maximizing both companies values, they had to ensure that the lease was a “true lease.” Windstream structured it like that. They also pitched it like that when selling Uniti securities to creditors and investors that traded Windstream debt and equity for Uniti’s. Windstream further claims that Windstream’s structural peculiarities somehow render the lease an unsecured and structurally subordinated financing. This would be news to Uniti’s investors, who purchased Uniti securities based on Windstream’s representations that Uniti owned that property and received rent payments from Windstream under a true lease.

Basically they would’ve intentionally misled potential creditors and investors. As a result I believe that on or around December 18th, 2019, Honorable Robert D. Drain will grant summary judgement in favor of Uniti, dismissing all claims of recharacterization the Master Lease as financing. This will remove all uncertainty from Uniti, will require that Windstream assume the Master lease unchanged and will also result in $UNIT trading at or around $20 by January 20th, 2020. 

Therefore, I suggest you get 5/15 - $10 Calls. They’re fairly cheap.


TL;DR: 5/15/20 $UNIT Calls

Edit: Also, I checked Aurelius’s 13F to look at their holdings. Here’s the kicker. They only hold two stocks, $AGO and $UNIT. They added to their position almost a half million shares.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright you paint huffers, try to get through this. It’s a good story. I’ve been watching $UNIT for half a year now since someone else posted a trade about it. I’ve continually bought into this stock as it goes lower and lower and lower and I think that, after my countless attempts to catch a falling knife, it’s finally bottomed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniti group is a REIT that constructs and acquires communications infrastructure through fiber, towers and leasing. They are a spin-off of Windstream Holdings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand what’s going on I have to start with who Windstream is. Windstream &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windstream_Holdings""&gt;is a provider of voice and data network communications&lt;/a&gt; in predominantly rural areas. Windstream was and is a growing and profitable business. In 2015, Windstream decided to create a spin-off REIT in a move that would allow them to &lt;a href=""https://investor.uniti.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windstream-board-directors-gives-final-approval-reit-spinoff-and""&gt;reduce more than $4 billion in debt and increase network investments&lt;/a&gt;. This was a pretty good move on their part as it freed up capital to continue making network investments and gave Windstream share holders a quarterly .25 cent dividend. It also allowed Uniti (then CS&amp;amp;L) to operate as an independent company. This was also good for the newly formed Uniti as some of the sale-leasebacks &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/05/09/uniti-group-inc-unit-q1-2019-earnings-call-transcr.aspx""&gt;have almost 100% margins&lt;/a&gt;. This is all good and well for except for two things: One, Uniti’s income now was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified and two, this spin-off &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-loses-legal-case-against-hedge-fund-aurelius-and-now-is-stuck-with-a-huge-bill-51550318739""&gt;tripped bond indentures&lt;/a&gt; meaning Windstream was now in default of issued bonds. This wasn’t an issue with most bond holders as they would be happy getting paid out when the bonds matured. Enter Aurelius Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aurelius Capital Management is a hedge fund operated by Mark Brodsky, a former bankruptcy lawyer. This is a ruthless man who is driven solely by profit and money and I’ll be goddamned if that’s not the way God intended things to be. This is the same man who &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-01-14/aurelius-capital-sues-argentina-over-gdp-linked-securities""&gt;attempted to force the government of Argentina to pay 1.3 Billion following the 2010 Argentinian default on debt.&lt;/a&gt;. They’re vultures, gotta respect the hustle. Anyway, in 2017, a couple years after the Windstream/Unit spin-off, Aurelius buys up 25% of Windstream’s 2023 Bonds, then hits up the local CDS (Credit Default Swap, yes like The Big Short) market and gets a handful of those. The CDS will pay out if Windstream ever misses a payment on its debt. Then they walk back over to Windstream and say hey, your spin-off of assets violated bond covenants and we want to accelerate the payments of these notes. You owe us full repayment plus interest, approximately 310 Million. Windstream, being the reasonable company they are, say hey we can’t pay that, we don’t have the capital for that, that will bankrupt us. Plus, we didn’t violate bond covenants. Windstream is pretty confident that they didn’t violate bond covenants but just in case, they issue more notes in order to dilute Aurelius’s bond holdings down to 6.25% of the 2023’s, they try and retroactively get waivers from other bond holders and they visit &lt;strong&gt;TWO&lt;/strong&gt; different law firms, both which say, Nah, you’re good bruh. You didn’t violate bond covenants. Subsequently, the stock price that had fallen to $2 per share rises to $7 per share over the course of the next few months. The Aurelius lawsuit was within the market&amp;#39;s Personal Risk Tolerance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 25th, 2019, Judge Jesse Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rules that Windstream did, in fact, violate bond covenants when it spun off its fiber-optic cable business into Uniti. This caught everyone by surprise except Bid Dick Aurelius who is now awarded 310.5 Million and &lt;em&gt;will get paid out by the CDS it had&lt;/em&gt;. What happened next is pretty brutal. Windstream immediately filed for a chapter 11 bankruptcy, watched its stock become a penny stock and has top executives &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-files-for-bankruptcy-calls-for-credit-default-swap-regulation-51551133206""&gt;claiming market manipulation&lt;/a&gt;. To which Aurelius responds, and I quote, “Windstream’s accusation of market manipulation is nonsense,” says an Aurelius spokesperson. “Rather than whining about us and Judge Furman, Windstream’s management and board should engage in much-needed introspection.” Basically, suck it up pussies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re probably wondering how this relates to Unit by now. Well, remember when I told you that Uniti’s revenue was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified? Well, they didn’t diversify quick enough. Windstream still accounts for 64% of Uniti’s revenue, which means when the ruling went against Windstream, Uniti’s stock price went down with it. To make matters worse, Windstream is looking to recharacterize a $650 million-per-year lease agreement with spinoff REIT Uniti Group Inc. as a disguised financing arrangement that siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars away from them. They’re saying that the lease was never actually a lease but a financing deal. They’re trying to claw back millions in payments in order to free up cash flow and get billions back in assets which are no longer theirs. This claim is artificially holding down Uniti’s stock price, as a ruling for Windstream could mean Uniti loses $650 million per year in the lease revenue. Here’s where we finally get to the trade. I believe that Uniti and Windstream will never even get to the court date that’s planned in March of 2020. Today, November 25th, a &lt;a href=""http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000010""&gt;summary of judgement&lt;/a&gt; was entered along with the supporting &lt;a href=""http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000011""&gt;memorandum of law&lt;/a&gt;. This essentially holds Uniti’s lawyers’ arguments about dismissing Windstream’s ridiculous attempt to recharacterize the lease as financing. It has compelling arguments and since I know you won’t read it, I’ll try and summarize the strongest argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I suggest you get 5/15 - $10 Calls. They’re fairly cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

About a 2 years ago, they fell due to the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, but held together a lot better than the failing Mattel, and were much better at shifting over to Target, Walmart and Amazon than others in the segment. Over this year, they surged from ~85 to ~120 off the back of Magic the Gathering's new digital ""Magic Arena"". Then, last quarter, they crashed back due to trade war bullshit, completely disregarding the continuing growth of Magic Arena and the upcoming release of Frozen 2.
&gt; 
&gt; Frozen 1 was an absurdly huge success. Disney was caught flatfooted for that and brought Hasbro on as a partner for their toy lines pretty late to the party, but it still literally doubled Hasbro's ""girl toys"" sales for the year. This time, Hasbro and Disney have been partnered from the beginning and have already gotten every store to push Frozen 2 toys since the beginning of the month. If Frozen 2 delivers even a reasonable fraction of Frozen 1's success, Hasbro's gonna pop off.
&gt; 
&gt; This is like... anti-priced in.

&gt; &gt; I bought a 4/17 $97.5 - $105 call spread when it dropped, and a 4/17 $95 call as soon as it dipped below 95, which turned out to be near the bottom. Because of yesterday's little run-up, I opened a pretty optimistic 1/17 $100, closed the $105 call and a closed a short-dated call against my 100 shares (both of those at a small loss, but I'm increasingly optimistic now that things are moving due to Yoda/Disney+). No plans on opening more positions, time to just ride it out until good news hits. Might even pussy out of one of those positions if this run continues. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In other words, I'm doing both, but I think the gain train has already left the station and I'm not going to chase after it. You'll have to come up with something on your own if you wanna get in.

Those claims are relatively easy to check from the various quarterly conference calls over the last 5 years or so, or you can trust a stranger on the internet.

Anyway, $HAS was up 2% yesterday and is already up another 1% premarket today, [Baby Yoda toys confirmed](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/baby-yoda-toys/index.html), and as I said earlier MTG Arena and Frozen 2 have been in their sights for a good long time now.

You see all those ~~murder and execution~~ merger and acquisition news . And you think, damn, I wish I bought MDCO calls last week . MDCO buyout price is 85 and it's about 84 now . You can buy MDCP for 84 and wait until execution to get your $1 of gain. You would have to put in plenty of capital now to get the measly 1.5% gain in some distant future

Or

You can sell puts. March 2020 80P goes for 0.55 per contract.  Sell 10 and it's 550 in your account. You don't put any capital in , it's all against your margin (how deep in debt your broker allows you to go) . Make that unlimited leverage in RH produce some cold cash . Now, not somewhere later. Even with 1 contract , it's $55 on $0 money in.

Is there any risk, you ask . Well, if the deal falls through  (e.g. AVGO buying QCOM ) the stock plunges and you get exercised ( they call it ""assigned"", but you would feel it more like ass-exercised ) you will make analfarmer proud. But seriously, it has to be hostile takeover attempt like it was AVGO-QCOM disaster.

My dad has a small portfolio but during lunch one day he asked me about options so I went on a rant about them and he was intrigued, to say the least, but I really didn’t think much of it. While he’s at work one day he sends me a screenshot of his first options trade ever. As many of you well know it expired dogshit worthless and now he just sent me another screenshot of a trade he wants to get in which is 265 Apple calls this Friday.

The bottom line is I’m thinking inverse every trade my dad makes. If I would have inversed his OTM Uber put gamble I would be sitting on 200% gains.

Haupt is known as an established player in the market, having enjoyed steady karma revenues quarter to quarter from his consistently high quality gif submissions. Haupt's brand enjoys similar type of loyalty as $AAPL, thanks to gifs that are guaranteed to make you chuckle, with quotes such as ""Beyond Meat? Isn't that a lesbian book club?” or random clips of copulating chimpanzees. The market is far from a monopoly though - with new entrants such as /u/Bipedal-Moose, with his memorable ""[Field of Tendies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/diunpo/field_of_tendies/)"". Over time it’s becoming clear that high quality alone is not enough for /u/haupt91 to distinguish his work - particularly given the generally half-witted population of /r/wallstreetbets who might underappreciate subtle differences between authors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disruption**

Just over two weeks ago /u/haupt91, following in the footsteps of Steve Jobs (iPad) and Jeff ""Lex Luthor"" Bezos (Kindle), unveiled a new category of a shitpost to the sub - one that does away with the sweet benefits of anonymity in the name of fame among the imbeciles visiting this cursed corner of the internet. With the [WSB YOLO King](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dtf7s0/wsb_yolo_king_lands_interview_on_cnbc/), /u/haupt91 has started a new era of /r/wallstreetbets \- the era of vlogging.

&amp;#x200B;

**Origins**

Until recently, /r/wallstreetbets members preferred not to show their likely unappealing faces - that is until /u/ControlTheNarrative changed the game with his legendary [I recorded today's market-open and the instant delta to my portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/) post. His brave move was rewarded with multiple reddit-coin badges, including the $100 dollar “Golden Fuckboy” and 3x GAY awards. The rawness of the video, culminating in the now-famous guttural “guh” sound, puts it firmly in the snuff-film category of /r/wallstreetbets hall of fame. It’s worth noting that /u/ControlTheNarrative didn’t set off to create a meme, or at least seemed to be taken off guard by its popularity. And thus, he quickly lost control of it, with derivative memes coming close to outshining the original - for example u/Orgasimo’s [Say Something I'm GUHving Up on You](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dr3eki/say_something_im_guhving_up_on_you_official_music/). This is in contrast to /u/haupt91 who so far hasn't inspired ""re-mixes"" of his work, but has been much more deliberate in building and controlling his brand.

&amp;#x200B;

**WSBloggers**

The latest stage of diversification of the /r/wallstreetbets meme economy is represented by u/Dejula’s post - [“Watch the downfall of Dejula”](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e01t9k/watch_the_downfall_of_dejula/). He skillfully weaved his humorous comments into a clip that on the surface was nothing more than a video version of a loss pic. The budget of the video was approximately $45k - highlighting barriers to entry for potential /r/wallstreetbets vloggers. By my estimates, a vlogger could have a good shot at disrupting the current market with a budget of approx $100k - this would enable five $20k YOLOs (amount that’s likely to attract attention) which could be spread over two quarters. It is my strong belief that u/Dejula's video will be remembered as one of the first real /r/wallstreetbets vlogs. He understood that numpties frequenting /r/wallstreetbets have no time for classic youtube-style vloggers, who rarely put their balls on the line - although I have no doubt that many will try to record PG-rated /r/wallstreetbets commentary vlogs, where no money is put at risk.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusions**

I believe this time next year we will have have several established shitposters specialising in video content. With 741k subscribers on /r/wallstreetbets, the addressable audience is large enough to wonder why this hasn’t happened earlier. It’s worth noting that due to high barriers to entry, monetisation won’t be the goal of those shitposters - but lack of monetisation hasn’t dissuaded thousands from visiting this Aleppo of investment forums every day.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/haupt91""&gt;/u/haupt91&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;started what I believe will be the next big thing on this sub - for better or for worse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But you stick to it and keep buying FD after FD in hopes of maximum tendies, and we salute you for that.

But what if you’re trying to do gay stuff like “manage your risk,” and make consistent returns from buying options? Well you’re in luck, because I have a strategy for you that literally cannot go tits in an upwards fashion and will lead you to the promised land of tendies.

1.) You must manage your risk. Your portfolio should not be entirely options. In fact, your portfolio should be anything less than 1.8% options. The rest of your money should be in this thing called a “high yield savings account.” Find one of these that has 1.8% interest or better, and let your reserve cash just sit in there. By year end, that account will have 1.8% gains just doing nothing!

2.) with your options account, you should be avoiding risky strategies such as but not limited to: long OTM FD’s, etc. The best option strategy you can employ is going long $CASH LEAP’s. A LEAP is an option with a long expiry. So basically you buy a cash leap by just going long on your cash and letting it sit there until expiry, but unlike other options, $CASH LEAP’s can’t expire worthless and are immune to theta decay, so you keep all your tendies!

3.) If you’ve employed this strategy correctly, even the most autistic of you should be making consistent returns. Hell, you may even ball out and make 2% a year if the fed decides to raise interest rates at any point. You are now making more than 90% of the users on this sub, congrats, you are now in the options trading elite.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you new guys coming from &lt;a href=""/r/all""&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; or somewhere else may be shocked when you come to the realization that most everyone here is losing money on a regular basis.

Snapchat is trading off its 200 day.

Twitter drop was due to a bug effecting the targeting effectiveness of their advertisements. Ad revenue is 90% of their business, so that's why investors freaked. This was a one time event that imo is an easy fix for the short-term.

$TWTR is actually profitable since 2018 and has 50% more monthly active users over $SNAP --- that by the way is at a market cap of 21B while twitter is at 23B.  So these two companies are basically worth the same to investors as it stands right now. 

If you ask me Twitter more strongly reflects a company like FB than it does Snapchat. And FB currently trades  at a P/e ratio around 31. Twitter's p/e is around half that at 14. 

I love using Snapchat but their business model is trash, everything they do gets copied by other platforms i/e Instagram stories. They're not a news outlet or a place to find information like twitter, monetizing off lens filters is a joke.

Last week stonk consolidated, affirmed mid 140s. If we look at this week we see HK had pro dem elections. China hasn’t rolled the tanks in... yet. China still wants a deal w Daddy. Frozen 2 is blockbuster and Baby Yoda will be under every Xmas tree.

Ferengi Rules of Acquisition


Once you have their money, you never give it back.

The best deal is the one that brings the most profit.

Never spend more for an acquisition than you have to.

A woman wearing clothes is like a man in the kitchen.

Never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity.

Keep your ears open.

Small print leads to large risk.

Opportunity plus instinct equals profit.

Greed is eternal.

Even if it's free, you can always buy it cheaper.

Anything worth doing is worth doing for money.

Anything worth doing is worth doing twice.

Keep your family close, keep your Latinum closer.

A deal is a deal. (until a better one comes along).

A contract is a contract is a contract (but only between Ferengi).

A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all.

Satisfaction is not guaranteed.

Only give money to people you know you can steal from.

Never place friendship above profit.

Never place friendship before profit.

A wise man can hear profit in the wind.

Latinum can't buy happiness, but you can sure have a blast renting it.

There's always a way out.

As the customers go, so goes the wise profiteer.

There's nothing more dangerous than an honest businessman.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought this might be a good topic to spitball about. I&amp;#39;ll post just the first few.&lt;/p&gt;

Next round of hikes set for early 2020

China is giving some bullshit promise that strokes Mango here [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/china-to-raise-penalties-on-ip-rights-violations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/china-to-raise-penalties-on-ip-rights-violations)

2 ways this can work out, either Mango takes the bait and cancels or reduces next tariffs hike or shit proceeds as before.

Either way there is going to be an impact on the ocean shipping industry. Import/exports waiting to be shipped gotta be getting front loaded in expectation of the outcome and we are getting close. So, either companies ship a fuckton when the deal goes through or ship a fuckton and pass the cost on to the consumer, since they still gotta make dem tendies to resupply the inventory post shopping season.

My plan right now is to try to figure out who is been holding out on inventory restock and what shippers they use then try  to play some FDs like a ~~chump~~ champ off of that.

Anyone done something similar? I am broke as fuck, so no Bloomberg terminal access to see where shippers are or supply chain data.

The thing with pickup trucks is that they're a huge market in the US, but let's face it 99% of truck people would not want to switch to electric as long as gasoline exists.

The Rivian, and big three electric pickups will sell in very low volumes (forget Amazon for a second). If Tesla had made a more normal-looking truck, it would have had a small share of a small sub-section of that market (aka electric pickup trucks).

Now this design is a much smarter way to approach it:

-not many people would've bought an electric Tesla pickup anyway, but now in addition to some of those people, other people may consider buying it. People who may not even need a truck, but who want to get it just for the badassery of the thing, or its originality. Or the low cost alone may attract buyers who would not have considered buying a pickup in the first place. A big deterrent to buying a truck is the fuel cost, but since electric motors are so efficient it's less of a concern.

-another thing to consider is I'm pretty sure this design has some super-efficient engineering benefits behind it, AKA they'll be able to make a good profit off of it, even at a low price. Less parts probably and other things. Which would have been more difficult with a more traditional-style truck.

-this unique styling is something that sticks in your mind. I remember at first I hated the design, then it stuck in my mind all day. I still don't think it's superb, but now when I look at every other vehicle including the Rivian or other teslas they look out of date. And after having this thought I saw people making posts about that same observation. Unbelievable...

-the last thing to consider is this got people talking about Tesla, huge amounts of free advertising, which will drive other model sales.

So yeah. I think there's way much more to this than just ""haha we made a cybertruck from the future""...

You small brains who keep commenting how retarded automation is in convoys have small pp and need to think what the technology &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do and not just the idea of a fucking automated convoy, ree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, you can play spades and dip while the convoy happens automatically. 👌&lt;/p&gt;

[Disney +] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Disney%2B#Upcoming_original_programming) vs. [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix).

My central thesis is that the release of Disney + will only serve to retroactively contextualize and reinforce Netflix's strategy of vast, ongoing investment in their original programming and act as the perfect foil against which Netflix can finally be compared to reveal just how ahead of the competition it truly is. I may say some disparaging things about Disney, but that in no way reflects my opinion on the direction of their stock - I am only commenting on Netflix here. 

Now, I tend to get long-winded in my writing, but I'm not trying to submit an essay for you degenerates so here are some draft bullets:

-	Netflix has done so much cool shit with their releases in the past, but it’s always gone under the radar or not been fully appreciated. Does anyone remember when they showed the trailer for Cloverfield: Paradox at the Superbowl, and it was available to watch right after? I remember thinking how much of a flex that was to the entire industry, realizing that no other company was positioned or even capable of doing something similar. Whether its movies, television, premium subscriptions, or streaming content - the current model is entrenched in the process by which it is monetized, which is to say that it is deliberately slow and hinges on the hype and anticipation of a release to ensure a return (sponsorships, advertising, product placement, IP, merchandising, etc). Game of Thrones comes to mind here for several reasons, not the least of which is that I started this bullet by mentioning Cloverfield, and both were series with promising beginnings that ended in pointless dogshit. However, in the case of Cloverfield: Paradox, Netflix was able to give it that type of a release and look good regardless of the movie’s reception. That’s a supreme flex, but if you’re already the biggest dude in the gym, you’re just alone straining your biceps in front of a mirror. Netflix Miyagi needed its own Cobra Kai so that next time it beats up a bunch of teenagers in an alley after a Halloween party, the viewing public knows who to look to and say, “Ooooooh shit, you gon’ take that!?” 

-	The thing is, it’s hard to call the mouse a cobra here, at least in my opinion now that the platform has been out for two weeks. Disney + to me feels barren and its release calendar, while full of great IP, isn’t really something to fawn over. I’m personally most interested in the upcoming Marvel series (Loki, Winter Soldier), but it’s difficult to justify staying a subscriber and being trickle-fed content when I can just cancel and wait a year to binge the best selections over the course of a weekend or two. The 10MM subscribers on release day doesn’t say anything except that people that frequently stream for entertainment are starved for content. 

-	Disney is a massive corporate stitching of media portfolios with tremendous value, but much like Frankenstein’s monster, it is conceivably stiff and inflexible in its operations due to the nature of its composition. The next time Netflix orchestrates another surprising/unique/buzzworthy release, all eyes will be on Disney + to meet or exceed (as is expected in a competitive market), but my expectation is that they will be unable to respond in kind for several years. All of the buzz surrounding Disney + now seems more and more like strictly paid advertising - disingenuous. Seriously, how quickly will the buzz for The Mandalorian *as a driver of the platform* diminish when on the same day as the release of its penultimate episode, Netflix drops a full season of the Witcher series. 

**The streaming wars will not be won solely by the quality of upcoming content, but by the frequency, consistency, and novelty of its release.** Right now it seems like Disney’s best bet is to become the staple family-oriented streaming platform, whereas Netflix is actually competing for most essential viewing platform, period.

Now, for the shit that matters: I started building a $1,000 position in Netflix on Wednesday, buying 310/315 calls expiring 11/29 - 12/06, and 325/340 calls expiring 12/27. Took some profit on Thursday, but still holding 315C - 11/29, and 340C - 12/27. Will likely continue to load up on Monday morning and I intend to hold through to at least Wednesday/Thursday, depending on how things move along. 

Feel free to discuss, I’ll post screenshots of my position if requested.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;List of Original Programs (volume comparison, just click and scroll):
&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Disney%2B#Upcoming_original_programming""&gt;Disney +&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix""&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My central thesis is that the release of Disney + will only serve to retroactively contextualize and reinforce Netflix&amp;#39;s strategy of vast, ongoing investment in their original programming and act as the perfect foil against which Netflix can finally be compared to reveal just how ahead of the competition it truly is. I may say some disparaging things about Disney, but that in no way reflects my opinion on the direction of their stock - I am only commenting on Netflix here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I tend to get long-winded in my writing, but I&amp;#39;m not trying to submit an essay for you degenerates so here are some draft bullets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix has done so much cool shit with their releases in the past, but it’s always gone under the radar or not been fully appreciated. Does anyone remember when they showed the trailer for Cloverfield: Paradox at the Superbowl, and it was available to watch right after? I remember thinking how much of a flex that was to the entire industry, realizing that no other company was positioned or even capable of doing something similar. Whether its movies, television, premium subscriptions, or streaming content - the current model is entrenched in the process by which it is monetized, which is to say that it is deliberately slow and hinges on the hype and anticipation of a release to ensure a return (sponsorships, advertising, product placement, IP, merchandising, etc). Game of Thrones comes to mind here for several reasons, not the least of which is that I started this bullet by mentioning Cloverfield, and both were series with promising beginnings that ended in pointless dogshit. However, in the case of Cloverfield: Paradox, Netflix was able to give it that type of a release and look good regardless of the movie’s reception. That’s a supreme flex, but if you’re already the biggest dude in the gym, you’re just alone straining your biceps in front of a mirror. Netflix Miyagi needed its own Cobra Kai so that next time it beats up a bunch of teenagers in an alley after a Halloween party, the viewing public knows who to look to and say, “Ooooooh shit, you gon’ take that!?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, it’s hard to call the mouse a cobra here, at least in my opinion now that the platform has been out for two weeks. Disney + to me feels barren and its release calendar, while full of great IP, isn’t really something to fawn over. I’m personally most interested in the upcoming Marvel series (Loki, Winter Soldier), but it’s difficult to justify staying a subscriber and being trickle-fed content when I can just cancel and wait a year to binge the best selections over the course of a weekend or two. The 10MM subscribers on release day doesn’t say anything except that people that frequently stream for entertainment are starved for content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is a massive corporate stitching of media portfolios with tremendous value, but much like Frankenstein’s monster, it is conceivably stiff and inflexible in its operations due to the nature of its composition. The next time Netflix orchestrates another surprising/unique/buzzworthy release, all eyes will be on Disney + to meet or exceed (as is expected in a competitive market), but my expectation is that they will be unable to respond in kind for several years. All of the buzz surrounding Disney + now seems more and more like strictly paid advertising - disingenuous. Seriously, how quickly will the buzz for The Mandalorian &lt;em&gt;as a driver of the platform&lt;/em&gt; diminish when on the same day as the release of its penultimate episode, Netflix drops a full season of the Witcher series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The streaming wars will not be won solely by the quality of upcoming content, but by the frequency, consistency, and novelty of its release.&lt;/strong&gt; Right now it seems like Disney’s best bet is to become the staple family-oriented streaming platform, whereas Netflix is actually competing for most essential viewing platform, period.&lt;/p&gt;

My hunch is that HP will announce the acquisition of it's company on their ER on the 26th. I was thinking we might see a response this weekend, so there is still time, but I think they will go forward with it on ER day. 

In my opinion, this is an only win situation unless by for some absolutely ridiculous reason HP sticks to their guns and denies the bid. But I think there are two scenarios that will most likely occur. HP will miss on ER and announce the Xerox buyout, pretty much saving any shorts. OR HP beats ER and the stock pushes to 22-23 but there is still the issue of addressing the Xerox bid, they can't escape it, and according to Xerox, HP shareholders will benefit from the buyout, pushing the stock maybe even to 24-25 if they beat and they agree to the acquisition. 

Either way, I don't think HP will holdout, I think this thing gets announced this week and I think it's a definite win for call buyers. I've also been seeing much more OI and Volume leading up to this week in HP calls. So do with this opinion what you will, but I'm buying in now while shits cheap.

They fucking hunt, do you think a mother fucker dressed in Carhartt would drive this

They do shit like mudding and driving on dirt roads, Elon stop it

They need to haul tools and shit for work, nobody and I mean nobody is pulling up on a job site with this fucking thing.

They pull campers and trailers, you think the lame ass dude pulling a camper arrives at  Yogi Bear Park with the family in the Cyber punk truck

They have a small dick, these fucks want something more flashy, women need to know they have money, a 40k garbage can on wheels won't cut it.

 I showed this truck to my test group of Beckys they thought it was movie prop. I told one of them, imagine we are on a date and the truck breaks down on the way home,  lucky for us I got an ATV charging in the back and I can give you a ride home still. She left me on ""unread""

Overall this truck fucks.

The only use I can think of for this truck is for local shoot outs, the homies can use the flat bed top as a shield. Sadly the windows don't catch bullets right now so put the new guys in the front.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/markets-may-get-a-boost-from-cheery-black-friday-consumer-sentiment-seasonal-strength.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s Thanksgiving time, and investors’ thoughts turn to holiday shopping and a year end Santa rally in the stock market.
*****
&gt; Some analysts think both could be pretty good this year.
*****
&gt; While Black Friday has probably lost some of its claim as the launch of holiday shopping, the Friday after Thanksgiving could provide an early glimpse of how much the consumer will spend this year. The National Retail Federation estimates sales should grow by about 4% in the holiday shopping season, enough to keep the economy rolling along.
*****
&gt; JP Morgan analysts, in a note Friday, said they expect sales to be up 4.9% during the holidays, much stronger than last year, when sales gained just 1.9% and shoppers were discouraged by a major sell off in the stock market.
*****
&gt; As for the stock market, it continues to reach for new highs, and some analysts say that shouldn’t change as the calendar progresses deeper into a seasonally strong time of year for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I actually like adding to equities through the rest of the year,” said Cayman Wills, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
*****
&gt; Wills said she is looking for a better economy, with now no concern about a recession next year. As a result, she began adding to industrials in September and now expects manufacturing data to turn around, supporting her view. She said, if ISM manufacturing data improves Dec. 2, as she expects, industrial company stocks should go even higher.
*****
&gt; The coming week is often a slow one, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and stock exchanges closing down early on Friday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Monday night on the economy, and there are some economic reports worth watching, including durable goods and personal income and spending Wednesday.
*****
&gt; A few final earnings reports are also expected, including Best Buy, HP, and Dell.
*****
&gt; In the bond market, the Treasury auctions $113 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching impeachment proceedings in the House, but analysts do not expect the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump to affect markets, since there is little chance he would be convicted by the Republican majority in the Senate.
*****
&gt; Developments on trade talks between the U.S. and China, are by far the most important event for markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s a call on trade in our view. You can’t really predict what Xi and Trump will do,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates, at Wells Fargo. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.75% Friday, from a high of 1.95% on Nov. 12. Rates have moved lower as concerns have increased that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal by Dec. 15, heading off a new round of tariffs expected to take effect that day.
*****
&gt; But stocks have not reacted as much to disappointing trade headlines, and are instead looking forward to a new round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The S&amp;P 500 was roughly half percent away from its all time high Friday.
*****
&gt; “Trade is the nugget that helped lead the market higher,” Wills said. “In August we were trading at 16 times [earnings], now we’re at 17.8 times. If the market took out the benefit we saw from trade, it would probably be about 8% lower. That’s not our base case.”
*****
&gt; She expects to see some form of a phase one trade deal, and investors will continue to monitor every headline and tweet about trade talks. U.S. trade negotiators were invited to China to take part in a new round of face-to-face talks, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Friday, Trump said a deal was close.
*****
&gt; “I think there will be continued positive momentum,” said Wills, adding that incumbent presidents know a good economy is important in an election year.
*****
&gt; # Stocks could ‘turkey trot’ higher
&gt; The week around Thanksgiving is often positive for stocks. “If we were using history as a guide, that means we could see the final leg of this turkey trot in the week of Thanksgiving where we end [higher], then spend the next week or so digesting the recent gain,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there likely will be a Santa rally this year, but the market typically dips in the middle of December before moving higher. “December is the best month [for the S&amp;P 500]. On average, it’s up 1.6% and also has risen 76% of the time since World War II. It’s the highest price change and the best frequency for an up move of any month,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler of T3Live. com said it’s very likely there will be a Santa rally taking the market higher into the end of December. “A lot of analysts have a target of 3,200 for this year, but we were a little ahead of ourselves. A week of digestion is welcome. Traders are looking to make sure the market holds 3,070 to 3,090 to give more confidence that the Santa rally could bring it to 3,200 by year end. The question is can the market hold these levels,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; The 3,090 level is the low from this past week, and the 21-day moving average, a momentum indicator, is at 3,075.
*****
&gt; “This week stocks took a little bit of a breather. Next week has a better chance of being seasonally strong,” he said. “This week was more of a breather than a break that could have happened on trade talks.”
*****
&gt; Retail will dominate in the week ahead, as markets watch the final group of store chains report earnings. Dollar Tree, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy report on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Target in the past week gave positive indications for the holiday shopping season, as did Walmart the week before. But Home Depot lowered its sales forecast when it reported earnings, and Macy’s slashed its outlook..
*****
&gt; “There are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas but CFRA does not see this weighing on sales,” said Stovall. “Our analysts expect the tight time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be a boon for retailers which have “buy-online-pickup-in-stores” capabilities.”
*****
&gt; Retail sales are important since the consumer drives more than two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; “The peak of the season includes 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 33 days last year, which is the shortest since 2013. Notably, with Cyber Week and online penetration growing, this is less a risk than the days of yore while the shorter season will likely lessen the depth of the slowdown in early December,” the JP Morgan retail analysts wrote.

# Big Year-to-Date Gains Through November Bode Well for December and 2020

&gt; Going back to 1949 we are on pace for the 10th biggest year-to-date through November gains for the S&amp;P 500 – and it’s a healthy sign for the rest of the year and next. We crunched the numbers for the S&amp;P 500 YTD gains as of the end of November. Average YTD November gains are 7.4%. The list below shows the Top 21 YTD November that are all twice the average, which we felt best represents the current situation.

&gt; Following Decembers and following years have had solid performance and average to slightly better than average results. After big YTD gains December is up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 1.7% and the next year is up 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 9.9%. The reinforces our positive outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020.

# Average Performance Nearly Doubles in Pre-Election Year Decembers

&gt; December is now the number two S&amp;P 500 month and the third best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). Last year DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of last year is not that likely. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half.

&gt; In pre-election years, December’s overall ranking remains about the same across the board however, average gains improve handsomely. DJIA averages 2.7%, S&amp;P 500 2.9%, NASDAQ 4.3%, Russell 1000 2.9% and Russell 2000 3.1%. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 pre-election year Decembers. DJIA’s worst pre-election December was in 2015 when it declined a modest 1.7%. DJIA’s best pre-election year December was in 1991, up 9.5%.

&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.

# Russell 2000 Q4 Best 20 Days

&gt; We have been tracking seasonal market behavior for over five decades and have highlighted fourth quarter strength, holiday trading patterns and monthly trading patterns among other seasonal trading strategies for years.

&gt; There has been a little twitter chatter of late about the old Russell 2000 4th Quarter Best 20 Days Strategy. Lore has is that the Best 20 Days of the 4th quarter for the Russell 2000 are the last two trading days of October, the first two of November, the last seven of November and the last nine of December.

&gt; For perspective I have compare the Russell 2000 to the S&amp;P 500 over these 20 “Best” Days. Russell 2000 does beat the S&amp;P 500 with a cumulative median gain over these 20 days since 1979 of 4.6% and an impressive record of up 38 of the last 40 years, while the S&amp;P 500 delivered a respectable median gain of 3.1%, up 37 of the last 40 years.

# Don’t Fear Record Highs

&gt; “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” – Warren Buffett

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has trended higher in an unusually persistent fashion recently. The benchmark has notched 10 record-high closes over the past four weeks, including four straight through November 18.

&gt; It’s human nature to get nervous when market conditions are too calm, especially with an uncertain outlook and an aging bull market. However, we urge investors not to lose sight of their goals.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has consistently powered past record highs. Since 1950, the benchmark.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-return-after-high_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks rarely move higher in a straight line, though. Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 2% in the month after a record-high close. In 2018, the S&amp;P 500 notched a record high September 20, only to fall nearly 20% by December 24. Volatility can be uncomfortable, and it can be difficult to stay focused on long-term prospects when prices are falling.

&gt; Luckily, history shows that even the swiftest sell-offs don’t last forever. After the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 20% slide in late 2018, it recouped all of its losses in the next four months. In 2011, the index dropped 19% from April to October before reaching new highs again in March 2012. The S&amp;P 500 even found its way back to record highs after the 2008–09 financial crisis, nearly 5.5 years after its 2007 October peak.

&gt; “Even though the path can be rocky, stocks have historically offered long-term opportunity for investors,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It’s important to stick to your investing plan in times of volatility and calm. We still view volatility as an opportunity for suitable long-term investors consider rebalancing portfolios or add to positions.”

# STrump vs. the Average Presidential Election Cycle

&gt; With year three of the current four-year Presidential Election Cycle coming to an end in six weeks, below is an updated look at the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year of the cycle going back to 1928. As shown, years one and two have historically been weaker than years three and four of the cycle. The S&amp;P has been up 56.5% of the time in both year one and year two, but the index has been up 81.8% of the time in year three and 72.7% of the time in year four. Year three has been by far the best year of the cycle with an average gain of 12.81%, and the playbook has stuck to the script in year three of the current cycle with the S&amp;P up 24.5% year-to-date. While year four has historically been consistently positive with gains 72.7% of the time, the average change for the S&amp;P in year four (+5.71%) is just barely better than the average change in years one and two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/trump-vs-cycle-table.png))**

&gt; Below we show the S&amp;P 500 under Trump so far versus a composite of the S&amp;P four-year Presidential cycle. The S&amp;P gained 19.4% in year one of the current cycle versus an average year-one gain of 5.7%. Year two is historically the worst year of the cycle with an average gain of just 4.54%, and in Trump's second year, the S&amp;P actually fell 6.2%. So far this year, the S&amp;P is up 24.5% versus the average gain of 12.8% during year three of the cycle. As shown in the chart, year four generally trends positively but experiences pullbacks shortly after Q1 and again in October leading up the Election Day before closing out the year strong.

# Which of These Sectors is Not Like the Other

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is right at all-time highs, but if you look at your portfolio or a random list of stocks, with some of the winners there are bound to be some clunkers. Before getting too restless, though, it's important to keep in mind that not all stocks rally or decline in unison with each other. The chart below perfectly illustrates this. In it, we show the average distance that stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading with respect to their 52-week highs. For the S&amp;P 1500 as a whole, stocks in the index are collectively trading an average of 16.2% from their respective 52-week highs. Large-cap stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are the closest to 52-week highs at just a hair above 10%. Mid Caps are down an average of 14.8% while small caps have been the big laggard with stocks in the S&amp;P 600 down an average of 22.2% from their 52-week highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs.png))**

&gt; Small-cap stocks have been a laggard for the last year, and one of the key drivers of that weakness has been the Energy sector. The chart below shows how far stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading relative to their 52-week highs broken out by sector. It's not often that you see one sector as such a big outlier relative to all the others, but the Energy sector is in a league of its own these days. Stocks in the sector are more depressed than any other, trading down an average of 42.8% from their 52-week highs. Behind Energy, the next closest sector is Communication Services at an average of 22.7%. That's a spread of more than 20 percentage points between the two sectors with stocks furthest below their 52-week highs!

&gt; While stocks in the Energy and Communication Services sectors are the furthest below their 52-week highs, sectors that are the closest include Utilities and Financials where the average stock in each sector is down less than 10% from their 52-week highs.

# What Does the Market Know About the Consumer That We Don't?

&gt; In just about any economic discussion you read or listen to these days, there's one recurring theme- the strong consumer is picking up the slack. Strong consumer sentiment and generational lows in the unemployment rate are just two of many examples. A search of the term ""strong consumer"" on Google Trends also illustrates the strength of the consumer. While there's still another nine days left in the month, searches for the term ""strong consumer"" in November are on pace to be the highest in at least a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112119-Strong-Consumer.png))**

&gt; So, we all agree that the consumer is strong. Right? Well, recently the market begs to differ. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector versus the S&amp;P 500 over the last year. When the line is rising, it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is outperforming the S&amp;P 500. However, when the line is falling it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is underperforming, and underperforming is what the sector is doing now...in a big way. Even as the S&amp;P 500 is up around 4% in the last month, the Consumer Discretionary sector is down 1%. While many traditional brick and mortar retailers that have fallen on hard times are in the sector because these stocks are already down so much, their weighting in the index has become very small. Meanwhile, stocks that have previously been big winners like Amazon.com (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), and McDonald's (MCD) are the sector's largest components. Does the market know something we don't?

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Saturday morning to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/wallstreetbets""&gt;r/wallstreetbets&lt;/a&gt;. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 25th, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/markets-may-get-a-boost-from-cheery-black-friday-consumer-sentiment-seasonal-strength.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Thanksgiving time, and investors’ thoughts turn to holiday shopping and a year end Santa rally in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some analysts think both could be pretty good this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Black Friday has probably lost some of its claim as the launch of holiday shopping, the Friday after Thanksgiving could provide an early glimpse of how much the consumer will spend this year. The National Retail Federation estimates sales should grow by about 4% in the holiday shopping season, enough to keep the economy rolling along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan analysts, in a note Friday, said they expect sales to be up 4.9% during the holidays, much stronger than last year, when sales gained just 1.9% and shoppers were discouraged by a major sell off in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the stock market, it continues to reach for new highs, and some analysts say that shouldn’t change as the calendar progresses deeper into a seasonally strong time of year for stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I actually like adding to equities through the rest of the year,” said Cayman Wills, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wills said she is looking for a better economy, with now no concern about a recession next year. As a result, she began adding to industrials in September and now expects manufacturing data to turn around, supporting her view. She said, if ISM manufacturing data improves Dec. 2, as she expects, industrial company stocks should go even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coming week is often a slow one, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and stock exchanges closing down early on Friday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Monday night on the economy, and there are some economic reports worth watching, including durable goods and personal income and spending Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few final earnings reports are also expected, including Best Buy, HP, and Dell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the bond market, the Treasury auctions $113 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are also watching impeachment proceedings in the House, but analysts do not expect the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump to affect markets, since there is little chance he would be convicted by the Republican majority in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developments on trade talks between the U.S. and China, are by far the most important event for markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a call on trade in our view. You can’t really predict what Xi and Trump will do,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates, at Wells Fargo. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.75% Friday, from a high of 1.95% on Nov. 12. Rates have moved lower as concerns have increased that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal by Dec. 15, heading off a new round of tariffs expected to take effect that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But stocks have not reacted as much to disappointing trade headlines, and are instead looking forward to a new round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The S&amp;amp;P 500 was roughly half percent away from its all time high Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trade is the nugget that helped lead the market higher,” Wills said. “In August we were trading at 16 times [earnings], now we’re at 17.8 times. If the market took out the benefit we saw from trade, it would probably be about 8% lower. That’s not our base case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She expects to see some form of a phase one trade deal, and investors will continue to monitor every headline and tweet about trade talks. U.S. trade negotiators were invited to China to take part in a new round of face-to-face talks, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Friday, Trump said a deal was close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think there will be continued positive momentum,” said Wills, adding that incumbent presidents know a good economy is important in an election year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stocks could ‘turkey trot’ higher&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week around Thanksgiving is often positive for stocks. “If we were using history as a guide, that means we could see the final leg of this turkey trot in the week of Thanksgiving where we end [higher], then spend the next week or so digesting the recent gain,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stovall said there likely will be a Santa rally this year, but the market typically dips in the middle of December before moving higher. “December is the best month [for the S&amp;amp;P 500]. On average, it’s up 1.6% and also has risen 76% of the time since World War II. It’s the highest price change and the best frequency for an up move of any month,” said Stovall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Redler of T3Live. com said it’s very likely there will be a Santa rally taking the market higher into the end of December. “A lot of analysts have a target of 3,200 for this year, but we were a little ahead of ourselves. A week of digestion is welcome. Traders are looking to make sure the market holds 3,070 to 3,090 to give more confidence that the Santa rally could bring it to 3,200 by year end. The question is can the market hold these levels,” Redler said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3,090 level is the low from this past week, and the 21-day moving average, a momentum indicator, is at 3,075.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This week stocks took a little bit of a breather. Next week has a better chance of being seasonally strong,” he said. “This week was more of a breather than a break that could have happened on trade talks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail will dominate in the week ahead, as markets watch the final group of store chains report earnings. Dollar Tree, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy report on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Target in the past week gave positive indications for the holiday shopping season, as did Walmart the week before. But Home Depot lowered its sales forecast when it reported earnings, and Macy’s slashed its outlook..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas but CFRA does not see this weighing on sales,” said Stovall. “Our analysts expect the tight time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be a boon for retailers which have “buy-online-pickup-in-stores” capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail sales are important since the consumer drives more than two-thirds of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The peak of the season includes 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 33 days last year, which is the shortest since 2013. Notably, with Cyber Week and online penetration growing, this is less a risk than the days of yore while the shorter season will likely lessen the depth of the slowdown in early December,” the JP Morgan retail analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Big Year-to-Date Gains Through November Bode Well for December and 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to 1949 we are on pace for the 10th biggest year-to-date through November gains for the S&amp;amp;P 500 – and it’s a healthy sign for the rest of the year and next. We crunched the numbers for the S&amp;amp;P 500 YTD gains as of the end of November. Average YTD November gains are 7.4%. The list below shows the Top 21 YTD November that are all twice the average, which we felt best represents the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Decembers and following years have had solid performance and average to slightly better than average results. After big YTD gains December is up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 1.7% and the next year is up 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 9.9%. The reinforces our positive outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3f59aa1b657802b503ab32ce0db9bbd/ed8d0afaa9464f0b-49/s500x750/f6168a118ffdc907a5e494d03ba771a76a7294c8.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Average Performance Nearly Doubles in Pre-Election Year Decembers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December is now the number two S&amp;amp;P 500 month and the third best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). Last year DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of last year is not that likely. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pre-election years, December’s overall ranking remains about the same across the board however, average gains improve handsomely. DJIA averages 2.7%, S&amp;amp;P 500 2.9%, NASDAQ 4.3%, Russell 1000 2.9% and Russell 2000 3.1%. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 pre-election year Decembers. DJIA’s worst pre-election December was in 2015 when it declined a modest 1.7%. DJIA’s best pre-election year December was in 1991, up 9.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://66.media.tumblr.com/95f58c7a8f6d6028d34c887e4823f539/28be27dff6a591d2-9f/s400x600/85d80dffe50b9ba98966dd719c3143a7672fcb43.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Russell 2000 Q4 Best 20 Days&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been tracking seasonal market behavior for over five decades and have highlighted fourth quarter strength, holiday trading patterns and monthly trading patterns among other seasonal trading strategies for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a little twitter chatter of late about the old Russell 2000 4th Quarter Best 20 Days Strategy. Lore has is that the Best 20 Days of the 4th quarter for the Russell 2000 are the last two trading days of October, the first two of November, the last seven of November and the last nine of December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For perspective I have compare the Russell 2000 to the S&amp;amp;P 500 over these 20 “Best” Days. Russell 2000 does beat the S&amp;amp;P 500 with a cumulative median gain over these 20 days since 1979 of 4.6% and an impressive record of up 38 of the last 40 years, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 delivered a respectable median gain of 3.1%, up 37 of the last 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://66.media.tumblr.com/561d546d830cce4205905f73ea7755d8/b29aa69cdb4ef152-26/s640x960/e1fde82ceb38f0323dd5dd80c7d8f2cedd295f9a.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Don’t Fear Record Highs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” – Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 Index has trended higher in an unusually persistent fashion recently. The benchmark has notched 10 record-high closes over the past four weeks, including four straight through November 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s human nature to get nervous when market conditions are too calm, especially with an uncertain outlook and an aging bull market. However, we urge investors not to lose sight of their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has consistently powered past record highs. Since 1950, the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-return-after-high_1.png?ssl=1""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks rarely move higher in a straight line, though. Since 1950, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has declined an average of 2% in the month after a record-high close. In 2018, the S&amp;amp;P 500 notched a record high September 20, only to fall nearly 20% by December 24. Volatility can be uncomfortable, and it can be difficult to stay focused on long-term prospects when prices are falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, history shows that even the swiftest sell-offs don’t last forever. After the S&amp;amp;P 500’s nearly 20% slide in late 2018, it recouped all of its losses in the next four months. In 2011, the index dropped 19% from April to October before reaching new highs again in March 2012. The S&amp;amp;P 500 even found its way back to record highs after the 2008–09 financial crisis, nearly 5.5 years after its 2007 October peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even though the path can be rocky, stocks have historically offered long-term opportunity for investors,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It’s important to stick to your investing plan in times of volatility and calm. We still view volatility as an opportunity for suitable long-term investors consider rebalancing portfolios or add to positions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;STrump vs. the Average Presidential Election Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With year three of the current four-year Presidential Election Cycle coming to an end in six weeks, below is an updated look at the average performance of the S&amp;amp;P 500 in each year of the cycle going back to 1928. As shown, years one and two have historically been weaker than years three and four of the cycle. The S&amp;amp;P has been up 56.5% of the time in both year one and year two, but the index has been up 81.8% of the time in year three and 72.7% of the time in year four. Year three has been by far the best year of the cycle with an average gain of 12.81%, and the playbook has stuck to the script in year three of the current cycle with the S&amp;amp;P up 24.5% year-to-date. While year four has historically been consistently positive with gains 72.7% of the time, the average change for the S&amp;amp;P in year four (+5.71%) is just barely better than the average change in years one and two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below we show the S&amp;amp;P 500 under Trump so far versus a composite of the S&amp;amp;P four-year Presidential cycle. The S&amp;amp;P gained 19.4% in year one of the current cycle versus an average year-one gain of 5.7%. Year two is historically the worst year of the cycle with an average gain of just 4.54%, and in Trump&amp;#39;s second year, the S&amp;amp;P actually fell 6.2%. So far this year, the S&amp;amp;P is up 24.5% versus the average gain of 12.8% during year three of the cycle. As shown in the chart, year four generally trends positively but experiences pullbacks shortly after Q1 and again in October leading up the Election Day before closing out the year strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Which of These Sectors is Not Like the Other&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is right at all-time highs, but if you look at your portfolio or a random list of stocks, with some of the winners there are bound to be some clunkers. Before getting too restless, though, it&amp;#39;s important to keep in mind that not all stocks rally or decline in unison with each other. The chart below perfectly illustrates this. In it, we show the average distance that stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 1500 are trading with respect to their 52-week highs. For the S&amp;amp;P 1500 as a whole, stocks in the index are collectively trading an average of 16.2% from their respective 52-week highs. Large-cap stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 are the closest to 52-week highs at just a hair above 10%. Mid Caps are down an average of 14.8% while small caps have been the big laggard with stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 600 down an average of 22.2% from their 52-week highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small-cap stocks have been a laggard for the last year, and one of the key drivers of that weakness has been the Energy sector. The chart below shows how far stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 1500 are trading relative to their 52-week highs broken out by sector. It&amp;#39;s not often that you see one sector as such a big outlier relative to all the others, but the Energy sector is in a league of its own these days. Stocks in the sector are more depressed than any other, trading down an average of 42.8% from their 52-week highs. Behind Energy, the next closest sector is Communication Services at an average of 22.7%. That&amp;#39;s a spread of more than 20 percentage points between the two sectors with stocks furthest below their 52-week highs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While stocks in the Energy and Communication Services sectors are the furthest below their 52-week highs, sectors that are the closest include Utilities and Financials where the average stock in each sector is down less than 10% from their 52-week highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs-Sectors.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What Does the Market Know About the Consumer That We Don&amp;#39;t?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just about any economic discussion you read or listen to these days, there&amp;#39;s one recurring theme- the strong consumer is picking up the slack. Strong consumer sentiment and generational lows in the unemployment rate are just two of many examples. A search of the term &amp;quot;strong consumer&amp;quot; on Google Trends also illustrates the strength of the consumer. While there&amp;#39;s still another nine days left in the month, searches for the term &amp;quot;strong consumer&amp;quot; in November are on pace to be the highest in at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we all agree that the consumer is strong. Right? Well, recently the market begs to differ. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector versus the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the last year. When the line is rising, it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is outperforming the S&amp;amp;P 500. However, when the line is falling it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is underperforming, and underperforming is what the sector is doing now...in a big way. Even as the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up around 4% in the last month, the Consumer Discretionary sector is down 1%. While many traditional brick and mortar retailers that have fallen on hard times are in the sector because these stocks are already down so much, their weighting in the index has become very small. Meanwhile, stocks that have previously been big winners like Amazon.com (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), and McDonald&amp;#39;s (MCD) are the sector&amp;#39;s largest components. Does the market know something we don&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;

Looks like it’s time for another episode of “u/thiccdadsclub explains shit to retards”!

When you place an order with a broker, whether to buy or sell a security (be that options, futures, shares of a triple-leveraged ETF that tracks Chinese REITs, or even a “stock”, whatever that is) you imagine that your order gets sent from your broker to the exchange, right? You think your order to buy one share of the latest weed stock is sitting up there on a server in NASDAQ’s data center waiting to be matched to a seller. Wrong, idiot. God you’re so fucking 
*stupid*.

Your broker has agreements in place with companies called “market makers” or “liquidity providers” or “dark pools” or other terms. I’ll call them liquidity providers. Your order goes to them, and they decide whether to pass it on to the exchange or whether to fill it from their own personal vault of cash and securities.

For example, suppose a stock is trading with a bid of $100 and an ask of $101. You, an idiot, submit a market order to your broker to buy one share and I, a genius, submit a market order to my broker to sell one share. By chance, our brokers both send the orders to the same liquidity provider, who decides to close the trades internally rather than send them to the exchange. They buy my share at the bid of $100 and then sell that share to you at the ask of $101, pocketing $1 in the process.

Now the liquidity provider can’t just pick any damn price to fill the orders at. By law they have to stick to the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), which are the bid and ask prices that the average customer would see on the real exchange(s) that trade that particular security.

The liquidity provider is allowed to do *better* than the NBBO though. For example, suppose on the exchange that same stock is trading with an ask of $100 and a bid of $101 and again, you submit a market buy order and I submit a market sell order. The liquidity provider could buy my share for $100.25 and sell it to you for $100.75. They only make $0.50 instead of $1.00 but now they can claim that they offer tighter spreads than available on the exchange and retail customers like us wet our panties with excitement at all the money we’ll make. This is called “price improvement”.

If the orders are *limit* orders instead of market orders, then the liquidity provider has to check how the limit compares to NBBO to see what price they would have to fill it at and whether price improvement is possible. For example, if your buy order had a limit of no more than $100.60 and my sell order had a limit of no less than $100.40 then the liquidity provider has to decide whether to fill internally at those prices, providing huge price improvement and only a $0.20 profit, or pass it on to the exchange.

Now note two important things. First, if there’s no volume for the security then there’s no NBBO and the liquidity provider isn’t going to fill it internally. This doesn’t really happen with stocks but with options you can pick stupid strike prices where there’s nobody buying or selling. The liquidity provider should send those orders to the exchange where they will wait until somebody wants them or they are canceled.

Second, the liquidity provider should never provide such huge price improvement that the customer sees a negative spread. Suppose you submit your limit buy order with a limit of $95 this time, far less than the national best bid. The liquidity provider would be stupid to fill that internally; it’s basically a guaranteed loss for them and a guaranteed profit for you.

A long iron condor is a set of four options contracts that are ordered at once. It doesn’t really matter what they are or why somebody would want one, just know that when you open a long iron condor you are placing four orders: 2 limit buys and 2 limit sells. All four orders have to fill or none are filled. When you open a long iron condor you immediately receive a credit. If all four options eventually expire worthless you keep the full credit; otherwise you lose some or all of it depending on what happens. You want the underlying security to be stable in price and the options to expire worthless.

It’s really easy to create an order for a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless; just pick ridiculous strike prices for the four “legs” of the order. But of course there won’t be any volume for an iron condor like that, because who would be taking the other side of that trade? To make it doubly worthless you could set your limits such that it would create a negative spread. The order should never fill; no human being would ever take the other side of that trade, paying way too much for worthless contracts.

But who needs a human being when you have a liquidity provider with buggy software and a broker with an appetite for risk!

Two users (the aforementioned u/aidangamer28 and u/bearhobag) have found that using Robinhood under certain conditions you can open a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless and has a ridiculous limit price and it *will* be filled... by Robinhood’s liquidity provider! And worse still, Robinhood will let you use that net credit to boost your leverage immediately, so you don’t even have to wait for the options to expire before spending the money (on more iron condors, obv.)

Essentially it seems that Robinhood’s liquidity provider (Citadel Trading or Virtu Financial) has a bug that causes them to internally fill orders for long iron condors with (1) low volume and (2) stupid limits. These orders should have gone to the exchange where nobody would take them, but instead they are being filled at whatever limit price the user asks for, even if that means an effective negative spread. I suggest we call this the “infinite price improvement” cheat code.

Hope that helps, don’t @ me you losers

Edit: It’s very unclear at this point what combinations of underlying securities, strike prices, and limits will exploit this bug. Both posters provided proof that satisfied the mods, but it only takes a hearty dick to satisfy the mods so.. 

It’s also unclear whether this is illegal or not. On the surface it seems that if Citadel wants to buy your shitty iron condors at your shitty prices then hey, that’s their business, keep selling them until they’re bankrupt. On the other hand, prison would suck.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends from &lt;a href=""/r/all""&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; are quite confused about this latest Robinhood fuckup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like it’s time for another episode of “u/thiccdadsclub explains shit to retards”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you place an order with a broker, whether to buy or sell a security (be that options, futures, shares of a triple-leveraged ETF that tracks Chinese REITs, or even a “stock”, whatever that is) you imagine that your order gets sent from your broker to the exchange, right? You think your order to buy one share of the latest weed stock is sitting up there on a server in NASDAQ’s data center waiting to be matched to a seller. Wrong, idiot. God you’re so fucking 
&lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your broker has agreements in place with companies called “market makers” or “liquidity providers” or “dark pools” or other terms. I’ll call them liquidity providers. Your order goes to them, and they decide whether to pass it on to the exchange or whether to fill it from their own personal vault of cash and securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose a stock is trading with a bid of $100 and an ask of $101. You, an idiot, submit a market order to your broker to buy one share and I, a genius, submit a market order to my broker to sell one share. By chance, our brokers both send the orders to the same liquidity provider, who decides to close the trades internally rather than send them to the exchange. They buy my share at the bid of $100 and then sell that share to you at the ask of $101, pocketing $1 in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the liquidity provider can’t just pick any damn price to fill the orders at. By law they have to stick to the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), which are the bid and ask prices that the average customer would see on the real exchange(s) that trade that particular security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liquidity provider is allowed to do &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than the NBBO though. For example, suppose on the exchange that same stock is trading with an ask of $100 and a bid of $101 and again, you submit a market buy order and I submit a market sell order. The liquidity provider could buy my share for $100.25 and sell it to you for $100.75. They only make $0.50 instead of $1.00 but now they can claim that they offer tighter spreads than available on the exchange and retail customers like us wet our panties with excitement at all the money we’ll make. This is called “price improvement”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the orders are &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; orders instead of market orders, then the liquidity provider has to check how the limit compares to NBBO to see what price they would have to fill it at and whether price improvement is possible. For example, if your buy order had a limit of no more than $100.60 and my sell order had a limit of no less than $100.40 then the liquidity provider has to decide whether to fill internally at those prices, providing huge price improvement and only a $0.20 profit, or pass it on to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now note two important things. First, if there’s no volume for the security then there’s no NBBO and the liquidity provider isn’t going to fill it internally. This doesn’t really happen with stocks but with options you can pick stupid strike prices where there’s nobody buying or selling. The liquidity provider should send those orders to the exchange where they will wait until somebody wants them or they are canceled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the liquidity provider should never provide such huge price improvement that the customer sees a negative spread. Suppose you submit your limit buy order with a limit of $95 this time, far less than the national best bid. The liquidity provider would be stupid to fill that internally; it’s basically a guaranteed loss for them and a guaranteed profit for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long iron condor is a set of four options contracts that are ordered at once. It doesn’t really matter what they are or why somebody would want one, just know that when you open a long iron condor you are placing four orders: 2 limit buys and 2 limit sells. All four orders have to fill or none are filled. When you open a long iron condor you immediately receive a credit. If all four options eventually expire worthless you keep the full credit; otherwise you lose some or all of it depending on what happens. You want the underlying security to be stable in price and the options to expire worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really easy to create an order for a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless; just pick ridiculous strike prices for the four “legs” of the order. But of course there won’t be any volume for an iron condor like that, because who would be taking the other side of that trade? To make it doubly worthless you could set your limits such that it would create a negative spread. The order should never fill; no human being would ever take the other side of that trade, paying way too much for worthless contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But who needs a human being when you have a liquidity provider with buggy software and a broker with an appetite for risk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two users (the aforementioned &lt;a href=""/u/aidangamer28""&gt;u/aidangamer28&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/u/bearhobag""&gt;u/bearhobag&lt;/a&gt;) have found that using Robinhood under certain conditions you can open a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless and has a ridiculous limit price and it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be filled... by Robinhood’s liquidity provider! And worse still, Robinhood will let you use that net credit to boost your leverage immediately, so you don’t even have to wait for the options to expire before spending the money (on more iron condors, obv.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially it seems that Robinhood’s liquidity provider (Citadel Trading or Virtu Financial) has a bug that causes them to internally fill orders for long iron condors with (1) low volume and (2) stupid limits. These orders should have gone to the exchange where nobody would take them, but instead they are being filled at whatever limit price the user asks for, even if that means an effective negative spread. I suggest we call this the “infinite price improvement” cheat code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps, don’t @ me you losers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: It’s very unclear at this point what combinations of underlying securities, strike prices, and limits will exploit this bug. Both posters provided proof that satisfied the mods, but it only takes a hearty dick to satisfy the mods so.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear whether this is illegal or not. On the surface it seems that if Citadel wants to buy your shitty iron condors at your shitty prices then hey, that’s their business, keep selling them until they’re bankrupt. On the other hand, prison would suck.&lt;/p&gt;

for the all new, Robinhood Infinite Money Glitch! What you have to do is find a company that offers high payouts for short term, low risk iron condors. For example you can buy two out of the money calls and two in the money puts and still get offered $30 for every $100 you spend, or an even better amount like I’ve been finding, example $50 for every $100 I spend, (and buy $100 I mean 1 iron condor and for $30 and $50 I mean the min credit you’d be receiving for buying 1 iron condor) and since these calls and puts are always very far away from the actual stock price you have a very low chance of the iron condor actually failing you if the stock goes up or down. 
  
I’ve been doing this to FB, TTWO, GOOGL, and AMZN. For example this iron condor is on TTWO (take two interactive), for the iron condor, I’m selling a 130 call, buying a 131 call, selling a 117 put, and buying a 116 put all expiring 12/6, and the price of TTWO is now $121. (LOOK AT THE PICTURES) The limit price for this trade is .03 but with the crazy bid ask spread price that happens after hours, Robinhood will ask you to put in your own limit price of .95 specifically for this trade, you’ll put that in the limit price section, then you will make $95 instead of $3 with an $100 collateral, and once Friday comes along you will have made $195 off of a $100 trade!
 
 (Next few sentences is pretty much what I just said but these sentences go for any stock and not just TTWO) Then what you do is buy however many iron condors of this trade you want. When you accept everything on the order page of the iron condor, it will ask you credit or debit, choose credit, then it will say this iron condor has a special bid ask spread and it will ask you to choose a limit price. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Right then and there you have to choose the special bid ask spread in the limit price section. In my example it gave me a .95 limit price giving me $95 for every $100 iron condor. Then you place the order and it will get placed when the market opens (or by the end of the market day). 
  
If the order doesn’t get placed because the limit price is too high, try lowering it by .10, if you can’t completely double your money with this iron condor this method will still work as long as you gain 50% of what the colateral cost is, so if you’re lucky and can find a regular iron condor offering 50% of what the colateral cost is, then you don’t even have to mess around with the limit price and that will insure the order gets placed! And yes you need someone to actually sell you the iron condor too and that’s what makes this glitch awesome as it gets filled with this ridiculous limit price. 
  
IF YOU’RE CONFUSED LOOK AT THE PICTURES AT THE END OF THIS POST AND THAT WILL HELP EXPLAIN EVERYTHING! Yes this does seem to be a somewhat weird iron condor trade so far but here’s the thing, you’re doubling the money your investing using margin so margin will also double the total amount of money it can lend to you, this will lead to unlimited gains/money! Then you keep on doing this method until this glitch gets patched and then we can all buy out google, we’ll all run the board and then we can take out assets and throw one huge damn party!!!!! 
  
See you all on Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Market Watch, Buisness Insider and Fox! By the way I can’t figure out a way to show my margin doubling so the picture is of GUH instead!

[See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4od5z/the_infinite_money_bug_uaidangamer28_discovered/f9f3rao/).

I wrote myself some scripts to interact with the Robinhood API back in March. While testing them out I found something weird. If you bought options with the bid/ask at 0.00/0.01 and then tried to sell them back with a multi-leg order, Robinhood would buy them back at 0.01 each.

The bid/ask was at 0.00/0.01. You would buy for 0.01. When you tried to sell back, the bid/ask would still be 0.00/0.01, so you should not have been able to sell. Yet the RH API would let you sell for 0.01. You could buy as many shit 0.00/0.01 options you wanted, your RH net worth graph would drop (reflecting your poor choice), and then you could get them all refunded and your RH net worth graph would go back up.

This never failed and I never had any money taken out of my account as a result.

I always thought this was an API-specific bug, and I was too scared to investigate it and risk legal trouble.

My guess is that /u/Aidangamer28's iron condors are erroneously getting filled due to a similar Robinhood order-flow bug. He accidentally found a way to abuse the bug I was too scared to look into.

Edit:
You could buy options for $0.01 and hold them for a couple of days (didn't try more). If they went to $0.00, you could get a full refund. If they went to $0.02 (happened in one of my tests), you would double your money.

When I went digging through the logs to show the mods, I understood what the actual mechanism was. The end result is still the same though, the order of things is just different. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4od5z/the_infinite_money_bug_uaidangamer28_discovered/f9f3rao/""&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote myself some scripts to interact with the Robinhood API back in March. While testing them out I found something weird. If you bought options with the bid/ask at 0.00/0.01 and then tried to sell them back with a multi-leg order, Robinhood would buy them back at 0.01 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bid/ask was at 0.00/0.01. You would buy for 0.01. When you tried to sell back, the bid/ask would still be 0.00/0.01, so you should not have been able to sell. Yet the RH API would let you sell for 0.01. You could buy as many shit 0.00/0.01 options you wanted, your RH net worth graph would drop (reflecting your poor choice), and then you could get them all refunded and your RH net worth graph would go back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This never failed and I never had any money taken out of my account as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

I told her I wouldn't go to the mall but then I thought about all the insider information I'd get from actually being inside stores so I said I'd go. 

First thing we see when we pull up to the Macy's at the mall, bunch of fucking garbage outside in their bushes.  Plastic bags, bottles, other shit, I was like mom what the fuck is Macy's on rn.  They got hella people inside, and not one poor fucker can go out and pull the shit off their bushes?  So we rolled through mad quick because there were just way too many red dresses and I'm a dude so like I'm not trying to be like that.  Short em, they're dying.

We head over to Tommy Hilfiger's.  Now idk if any of you have been unfortunate enough to walk into a TH store, but holy shit I have never seen an uglier collection of clothing.  There were like these sleeveless puffer vests that had these rainbow-plaid patterns all over that I have never seen a single soul wearing.  I actually stayed in Hilfiger's more than other stores because I was just in so much amazement at how ugly their shit was. Short the fuck out of em.

Anyway, tried Ralph Lauren, wasn't a 65 year old golf-bro so I left. They're so fucking boring, Iron Condor is the play.

Eventually I just walked past an American Eagle, saw a decent looking jacket, walked in, it was 60% off, bought it and left. Long AEO, profit margins may be tight tho.

Now I would make these plays before next earnings calls myself, but my RH has 28 cents left down from 1300 bucks so hopefully someone else can capitalize on this dd.

I’m 80% sure on this. But if I’m wrong and you lose money just remember that you listened to a random guy on the internet. On the other hand if you win bigly, remember that it was all thanks to a guy on the internet. Good luck

Now you’ve got two scenarios, the more likely one is that you being the autist that you are lose it all but instead of losing 2000$ you write that sucker off on ur taxes and since ur income is now only 12000$ you don’t pay that higher tax bracket and that 2000$ yolo was only 600$.

[SwaggyStonks - WSB Analyzer and YOLO tracker.](https://www.swaggystocks.com)

&amp;#x200B;

It contains a WSB '**Sentiment' analyzer**, **Due Diligence** tracker, and a **YOLO tracker**.

I've recently added a new section that will contain full, in-depth ""Due Diligence"" reports on certain companies that will include all the data someone needs to know about the company if they want to trade their stock.

**Quick ""How it works""**

I log positions of posts flagged as ""YOLO/Gains/Losses"" and post them to my site. For actual options YOLO plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the win/loss percent. Every position on the site links back to it's appropriate thread on WallStreetBets so you can take a look and read the comments/juicy details as well! All other gains, losses, and expired YOLOs are placed in the ""Expired YOLOs"" section.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note I do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the OP of the YOLO disappears in which case I let the YOLO ride until expiry. It's fun to see what they could be worth!

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Cool Features The Site Has:**

\-**Top YOLO**s section (sorted by upvotes, gains, and losses)

\-**Competitor Analysis Tool**: Compare fundamentals/financials for different tickers.

\-**Options Scanner Tool**: View historical estimated ""prices"" of options. A good tool to view which options are currently expensive or cheap at different ranges of OTM.

\-**Credit Spread Finder**: Search tickers and find how much premium you can receive at 'x' percentage of being OTM and how much you are risking.

\-**Dividend Screener**: Search stocks that offer a dividend and filter them by: sector, dividend amount, and dividend frequency.

If anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!

#Introducing the r/wallstreetbets Hedge Fund!

We're over 700k in this sub, if we should all contribute $10 each, that'll give us $7million.

The money will be given to the manager of the fund (me of course) to invest in behalf of the sub!

Everybody will be a shareholder.

Now, using advanced strategies I've learned from the greats like u/Analfarmer2, u/1ronyman and u/ControlTheNarrative, I can expertly sell puts and buy calls, making us a shitload of tendies monthly.

I currently have $18.67 under management, projected  to grow exponentially, so you can tell I'm an expert and this can't go tits up.


Dividends will be distributed yearly to all members of the sub.

When it comes to gene-replacement, there aren’t very many options. You can either use Crispr, or modified viruses. The difference is similar to “cutting” &amp; “pasting” with a scalpel, versus exploding &amp; inserting with a bomb.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/december-could-be-good-for-the-stock-market-but-theres-one-big-risk.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks have had a bang-up year so far, and they’re heading straight into the month that is often the best of all.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 25% for the year. Thanksgiving week was technically positive for the market, with the small cap Russell 2000 breaking out, joining other indexes in an uptrend.
*****
&gt; Stocks, however, were lower Friday in sluggish trading after the Thanksgiving holiday. Through Wednesday, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 had all popped to new record highs, with consumer discretionary and tech names leading the market higher this past week. The Russell 2000 is not yet back to its highs, but it pushed above its previous 52-week high, in a healthy sign for the overall market.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, investor focus will move more intently to the topic of trade, and that is what will make or break the rally at year-end.

&gt; President Donald Trump has promised that a preliminary trade deal with China is close, but there still is no agreement and the Dec.15 deadline for new tariffs is getting closer. Trump’s signing of legislation Wednesday supporting the Hong Kong protesters drew a negative reaction from Beijing and adds more uncertainty to trade talks.
*****
&gt; The health of the economy is also a factor for markets, and there is some key data, with the ISM manufacturing report on Monday followed by the government’s all-important monthly jobs data on Friday.
*****
&gt; # Best month of year
&gt; 2019 has turned out to be a very good year for the market, with the Jan. 1 to Thanksgiving Day period the 14th best for the S&amp;P 500 since 1928, according to Bespoke. The 25.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500 was the best for the period since 2013, and now the market enters a typically strong period.
*****
&gt; “December is the best month of the year. The S&amp;P is up 1.6 percent on average. It also has the highest frequency of advances, up 76% of the time,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. December is also the least volatile month of all, but it could see some bumps.
*****
&gt; “The market tends to go through a mid-December low, which then represents a good buying opportunity, at least through the end of January,” Stovall said, adding he thinks the decline would be no more than 5%. “I don’t think we need a big pullback or a correction. A mid-single digit decline would be sufficient.”
*****
&gt; Stovall said 2019 was set up to win because of the way the year started, following the sharp sell-off last December. When the months of January and February are higher, the S&amp;P 500 has an average total return of 24%, according to data going back to 1945. If the following year does not see have a similar double gain in January and February, it still does fairly well with a normal average return of 8% to 9%, he said.
*****
&gt; The market’s performance for the entire year also bodes well for a positive move into year-end, according to Bespoke. Since 1928, when stocks are up 20% or more by Thanksgiving, like this year, the S&amp;P 500 usually ends the year even higher, with an average gain of 1.8% between Black Friday and New Year’s Eve, Bespoke noted.
*****
&gt; # S&amp;P Sub-industry sector performance
&gt; Stovall also looked at sector performance for December, going back to 1995 and found that some of the worst performing S&amp;P sub-industry sectors were retail oriented and are highly dependent on good holiday sales. On average, computer and electronics retailers were weakest, off 4.5%, followed by leisure products off 2.2% and department stores, off 0.9%. Specialty stores and apparel and luxury goods were also among the 10 poorest performers.
*****
&gt; While 87% of the sub-industry sectors were positive, the top performer was homebuilding, up 4.5 %, followed by home improvement retail.
*****
&gt; “You want to buy now what nobody wants to own,” said Stovall, noting the market is forward pricing so investors are looking ahead to building activity picking up in spring and summer when they dip into homebuilders. Companies that sell fertilizers also do well in December.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Friday closed out their best monthly performance since June. The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.4% to 3,140, and the Dow closed Friday at 28,051, up 3.7% for the month of November.
*****
&gt; Technology was the best performing sector for the month, gaining 5.2%. That helped drive the Nasdaq up 4.5% for the month to 8,665.
*****
&gt; Biotech was also a top performer, helping lift the Russell 2000, which gained 4% in November to 1,624. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up 11% for the month.
*****
&gt; # Trade tensions
&gt; The big risk to the market in December is the outcome of trade talks, but economic reports will be important as investors continue to assess whether the Fed was right in ending its rate cuts.
*****
&gt; The economy has shown some signs of picking up, and a string of improved data has led economists to look for better growth in the fourth quarter. But the critical driver of growth continues to be the consumer, so holiday sales will be an important indicator to watch.
*****
&gt; Employment data remains the most important of the economic reports, since a strong labor market is crucial for consumer confidence and spending.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the economy added 183,000 jobs in November, according to Refinitiv. The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, even with the negative drag of 46,000 striking GM workers and the reduction of 17,000 federal government jobs, due to the end of temporary employment for Census workers.
*****
&gt; “For the employment report, we think one factor that is likely to result in a slightly stronger headline payroll number is the fact we will now count the GM workers that were on strike,” said Barclays economist Pooja Sriram. “We estimated 36,000 to 40,000 were left out of the report in October. We think they’re to be counted as part of the November report. Much of that is going to be seen in private payrolls and especially in manufacturing payrolls.”
*****
&gt; In October, ISM manufacturing activity improved, and even though it remained in contraction, some economists said the slowdown may be showing signs of bottoming.
*****
&gt; The ISM index is expected to be at 49.4, still shy of 50, which shows expansion, but better than October’s 48.3. “We still think it’s going to be a sub-50 print,” said Sriram.
*****
&gt; October’s durable goods report showed a surprise gain in business investment when economists had expected to see contraction.
*****
&gt; Sriram said the speed of decline in manufacturing has certainly slowed, and she is watching the data closely. “I don’t think we’re comfortable saying we bottomed,” she said.
*****
&gt; OPEC and Russia hold meetings in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, and analysts expect them to extend their production cutting agreement. However, Russia may seek to change the rules for how it counts its petroleum output, so the meeting may not be as predictable as expected, some analysts say.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/29/19

&gt; Even with a holiday and a shortened session Friday leaving no US releases in the past 48 hours, it was a very busy week for economic data with 36 releases in the first three days. Most of this data came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading where there were no forecasts. While the bulk of the week's data was strong, manufacturing data, namely from the regional Fed indices, was mixed. We started off with a weaker Chicago Fed National Activity Index on Monday. The index fell from -0.45 last month to -0.71 rather than the expected improvement to -0.2. The Dallas Fed's index was also out on Monday and it improved more than expected as well as versus the prior month. On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed's gauge on manufacturing was also worse than expected. On the bright side, other manufacturing hard data like durable goods came in much stronger than both the previous month and consensus forecasts. Housing data was also solid this week with better than anticipated home price growth shown in two of the three indicators: the quarterly Home Price Purchase Index, FHFA, and Case-Shiller (only the Case-Shiller index was weaker than expected, albeit up from the prior month). The second release of third-quarter GDP was the most notable indicator of the week with a much stronger than expected reading which showed the economy grew by 2.1% QoQ versus estimates of a 1.9% growth rate.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco1.png))**

&gt; We kick off December with another busy few days next week. Final November Markit and ISM numbers will kick off the week on Monday. While Markit is not expecting any change from the preliminary readings, ISM is expected to improve to 49.2 which would still be a contractionary print. In hard manufacturing data, later in the week we will see final durable and capital goods numbers for November. Vehicle sales figures will be the only release on Tuesday followed by the service counterparts to Markit and ISM indices on Wednesday as the rest of the week's main focus will be on labor data. After a surprisingly strong release last month, Nonfarm Payrolls is again expecting a strong print showing 190K jobs created in the month of November.

# Stocks To Be The Most Thankful For

&gt; Below is a list of the 25 best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tops the list with a gain of more than 100%. While no other S&amp;P 500 stocks have yet to double this year, another semi name, Lam Research (LRCX) has come close with a gain of 99%. Xerox (XRX), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Target (TGT) have also all risen more than 90%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-2.png))**

&gt; Apple (AAPL) is the 19th best performing stock in the list above. But because of its trillion+ dollar market cap, Apple's (AAPL) 69% gain has a much bigger impact on the overall stock market than all of the other stocks that have seen a bigger price move this year. In fact, of the S&amp;P 500's 25% price gain this year, Apple has accounted for 2.24 of those percentage points (or roughly 9%).

&gt; Instead of looking at simple year-to-date price change, below is a list of the stocks that investors should be most thankful for this year because of their contribution to the S&amp;P's gains. Right behind Apple (AAPL) in first is the other trillion+ dollar company -- Microsoft (MSFT) -- which has accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 25% gain. After AAPL and MSFT are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Together these five mega-caps account for 25% of the S&amp;P's move higher this year. While this group of companies has been vilified in 2019 for a number of things, they're certainly still delivering for the stock market in a big way.

# S&amp;P 500 Industry Group Breadth Running Strong

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 may be hitting record highs at a pace of more than once every other day, but would you believe that there are still Industry Groups trading below their 50-day moving averages? The chart below shows the rolling percentage of Industry Groups trading above their 50-DMAs over the last several years, and the current reading stands at 91.7%. Over the last five years there have been numerous periods where a higher percentage (and even 100%) of Industry Groups traded above their 50-DMAs, and the most recent was back in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA-Chart.png))**

&gt; So which are the two outlier groups that are still below their 50-DMAs? Well, when everyone seems to be taking an offensive posture in the market, it's only natural that defensive sectors would be lagging, and two of the most defensive-oriented sectors in this yield-hungry world we live in are Utilities and Real Estate. Even these two groups, though, are only about 1% below their 50-DMAs, so all it will take is one or two good days for these groups to get them back over the hump. On the upside, Health Care Equipment &amp; Services is the furthest above its 50-DMA at 7.72%.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is currently just over 4% above its 50-DMA. What's interesting to note here, though, is that just 9 of the 24 Industry Groups are further above their 50-DMAs while 15 are not above their 50-DMAs by as much as the S&amp;P 500. In terms of YTD returns, the S&amp;P 500 is currently sitting on a gain of more than 25% YTD. Leading the way higher this year, Tech Hardware (Apple) has rallied just under 48%, while Semis are up just over 40%. Behind these two leaders, four other Industry Groups are up over 30% YTD. While there is no downside on a YTD basis, Energy has been the biggest laggard and is just barely hanging on to a YTD gain. If Energy can't hang onto a YTD gain in a year where the S&amp;P 500 gains more than 25%, Energy investors may need to wear paper bags over their heads.

# Technology Sector P/E Highest in Ten Years

&gt; As equities run to all-time highs, valuations are at a fairly interesting point. As shown in the chart below using data from our Daily Sector Snapshot included with our Morning Lineup and The Closer, most sectors' valuations are at the upper end of the past ten years' range. Four sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Utilities, and Technology all have trailing P/E ratios in the 90th percentile or higher of the past ten years' readings.

&gt; Since the S&amp;P 500 established its first all-time high since July on October 28th, Health Care and Financials have been two of the strongest performers rising 6.68% and 4.35%, respectively. Despite these runs, both of these sectors still have reasonable valuations relative to the past decade. For Financials, the current trailing price-to-earnings ratio is in the 42nd percentile of all days of the past ten years. No other sector has such a low reading although Materials and Energy are on the lower end relative to other sectors. On the other hand, Utilities and Technology have some of the highest valuations of the past ten years with the current P/E in the 97th and 99th percentiles, respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/PE2.png))**

&gt; As shown in the chart below, most of the last 9-12 months has seen valuations for Utilities consistently in the uppermost range of the past ten years as investors chased yield in a low interest rate environment. But as risk-free rates have risen more recently, valuations for Utilities have pulled back a bit as price has slid. While there have been other periods in the past ten years where Utilities' P/E ratio was similarly elevated, arguably only 2016/2017 saw it remain at the upper end of the ten-year range as consistently as has been the case this year.

&gt; For Technology it is a whole different story. The P/E for the sector got crushed this time last year and after plummeting to the 31st percentile, it is has rebounded to the highest levels of the past ten years. The only other time that the sector traded at a similar premium relative to the past decade's range was back in early 2018.

# Thanksgiving through Santa Claus Rally Trade

&gt; Everyone is talking about yearend seasonal strength this year, but it’s not news to us. 2019 has been tracking historical seasonal market patterns quite closely this year and that suggests it is likely to continue to track it.

&gt; Our good friend Larry McMillan (@optstrategist) trades seasonal yearend strength with the Russell 2000 from the close the day before Thanksgiving through the end of our Santa Claus Rally (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year).

&gt; So here we have run the numbers from 1979 when the Russell index data begins comparing R2K to the DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. The small-cap index Russell 2000 is the best performer up an average 3.1% (median 3.2%) with an 80% win ratio up 32 of the last 40 years. Last year was the worst and it’s been down 3 of the last 5 years.

# Giving Thanks for the U.S. Consumer

&gt; This Thanksgiving, we’re thankful for solid consumer confidence, even though it has wavered in recent months.

&gt; Consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November, according to preliminary Conference Board data. Even though the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has dropped from its economic cycle peak, consumer sentiment is still historically elevated, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/consumer-confidence_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We’ve been pleasantly surprised by the U.S. consumer’s resilience over the past year as other parts of the domestic economy have weakened amid global headwinds. Strong consumer spending has helped the economy grow at a 2% average rate over the past two quarters, despite drags on growth from business spending, inventories, and trade.

&gt; “Consumer sentiment has been largely immune from global headwinds,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect consumer spending to power economic growth through next year, so we’d like to see consumer confidence pick up more with signs of trade progress.”

&gt; Consumers have several reasons to be optimistic. Employment is the primary driver of consumer health, and the U.S. labor market has been resilient. Wages are growing at a healthy rate, and consumers are reaping the benefits of tax cuts and record-high stock prices. As long as the job market stays solid and inflation remains in check, we feel good about consumers’ prospects.

&gt; Still, there are growing signs of concern. While survey respondents have remained optimistic about present conditions, their outlook on future conditions has soured, according to the Conference Board. If consumers are feeling less confident about the future, they may be less inclined to spend and invest. That loss of confidence in the outlook could lead to economic weakness over time if consumers step back.

&gt; Overall, we would need to see more significant deterioration in consumer confidence before we would start to worry about the economic outlook.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Saturday morning to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/wallstreetbets""&gt;r/wallstreetbets&lt;/a&gt;. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 2nd, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/december-could-be-good-for-the-stock-market-but-theres-one-big-risk.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks have had a bang-up year so far, and they’re heading straight into the month that is often the best of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is up more than 25% for the year. Thanksgiving week was technically positive for the market, with the small cap Russell 2000 breaking out, joining other indexes in an uptrend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks, however, were lower Friday in sluggish trading after the Thanksgiving holiday. Through Wednesday, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;amp;P 500 had all popped to new record highs, with consumer discretionary and tech names leading the market higher this past week. The Russell 2000 is not yet back to its highs, but it pushed above its previous 52-week high, in a healthy sign for the overall market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming week, investor focus will move more intently to the topic of trade, and that is what will make or break the rally at year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has promised that a preliminary trade deal with China is close, but there still is no agreement and the Dec.15 deadline for new tariffs is getting closer. Trump’s signing of legislation Wednesday supporting the Hong Kong protesters drew a negative reaction from Beijing and adds more uncertainty to trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health of the economy is also a factor for markets, and there is some key data, with the ISM manufacturing report on Monday followed by the government’s all-important monthly jobs data on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Best month of year&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 has turned out to be a very good year for the market, with the Jan. 1 to Thanksgiving Day period the 14th best for the S&amp;amp;P 500 since 1928, according to Bespoke. The 25.5% gain in the S&amp;amp;P 500 was the best for the period since 2013, and now the market enters a typically strong period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“December is the best month of the year. The S&amp;amp;P is up 1.6 percent on average. It also has the highest frequency of advances, up 76% of the time,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. December is also the least volatile month of all, but it could see some bumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The market tends to go through a mid-December low, which then represents a good buying opportunity, at least through the end of January,” Stovall said, adding he thinks the decline would be no more than 5%. “I don’t think we need a big pullback or a correction. A mid-single digit decline would be sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stovall said 2019 was set up to win because of the way the year started, following the sharp sell-off last December. When the months of January and February are higher, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has an average total return of 24%, according to data going back to 1945. If the following year does not see have a similar double gain in January and February, it still does fairly well with a normal average return of 8% to 9%, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market’s performance for the entire year also bodes well for a positive move into year-end, according to Bespoke. Since 1928, when stocks are up 20% or more by Thanksgiving, like this year, the S&amp;amp;P 500 usually ends the year even higher, with an average gain of 1.8% between Black Friday and New Year’s Eve, Bespoke noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;S&amp;amp;P Sub-industry sector performance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stovall also looked at sector performance for December, going back to 1995 and found that some of the worst performing S&amp;amp;P sub-industry sectors were retail oriented and are highly dependent on good holiday sales. On average, computer and electronics retailers were weakest, off 4.5%, followed by leisure products off 2.2% and department stores, off 0.9%. Specialty stores and apparel and luxury goods were also among the 10 poorest performers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 87% of the sub-industry sectors were positive, the top performer was homebuilding, up 4.5 %, followed by home improvement retail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You want to buy now what nobody wants to own,” said Stovall, noting the market is forward pricing so investors are looking ahead to building activity picking up in spring and summer when they dip into homebuilders. Companies that sell fertilizers also do well in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks on Friday closed out their best monthly performance since June. The S&amp;amp;P 500 was up 3.4% to 3,140, and the Dow closed Friday at 28,051, up 3.7% for the month of November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology was the best performing sector for the month, gaining 5.2%. That helped drive the Nasdaq up 4.5% for the month to 8,665.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biotech was also a top performer, helping lift the Russell 2000, which gained 4% in November to 1,624. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up 11% for the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Trade tensions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big risk to the market in December is the outcome of trade talks, but economic reports will be important as investors continue to assess whether the Fed was right in ending its rate cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economy has shown some signs of picking up, and a string of improved data has led economists to look for better growth in the fourth quarter. But the critical driver of growth continues to be the consumer, so holiday sales will be an important indicator to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment data remains the most important of the economic reports, since a strong labor market is crucial for consumer confidence and spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists expect the economy added 183,000 jobs in November, according to Refinitiv. The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, even with the negative drag of 46,000 striking GM workers and the reduction of 17,000 federal government jobs, due to the end of temporary employment for Census workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the employment report, we think one factor that is likely to result in a slightly stronger headline payroll number is the fact we will now count the GM workers that were on strike,” said Barclays economist Pooja Sriram. “We estimated 36,000 to 40,000 were left out of the report in October. We think they’re to be counted as part of the November report. Much of that is going to be seen in private payrolls and especially in manufacturing payrolls.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, ISM manufacturing activity improved, and even though it remained in contraction, some economists said the slowdown may be showing signs of bottoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISM index is expected to be at 49.4, still shy of 50, which shows expansion, but better than October’s 48.3. “We still think it’s going to be a sub-50 print,” said Sriram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October’s durable goods report showed a surprise gain in business investment when economists had expected to see contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sriram said the speed of decline in manufacturing has certainly slowed, and she is watching the data closely. “I don’t think we’re comfortable saying we bottomed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPEC and Russia hold meetings in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, and analysts expect them to extend their production cutting agreement. However, Russia may seek to change the rules for how it counts its petroleum output, so the meeting may not be as predictable as expected, some analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Next Week&amp;#39;s Economic Indicators - 11/29/19&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with a holiday and a shortened session Friday leaving no US releases in the past 48 hours, it was a very busy week for economic data with 36 releases in the first three days. Most of this data came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading where there were no forecasts. While the bulk of the week&amp;#39;s data was strong, manufacturing data, namely from the regional Fed indices, was mixed. We started off with a weaker Chicago Fed National Activity Index on Monday. The index fell from -0.45 last month to -0.71 rather than the expected improvement to -0.2. The Dallas Fed&amp;#39;s index was also out on Monday and it improved more than expected as well as versus the prior month. On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed&amp;#39;s gauge on manufacturing was also worse than expected. On the bright side, other manufacturing hard data like durable goods came in much stronger than both the previous month and consensus forecasts. Housing data was also solid this week with better than anticipated home price growth shown in two of the three indicators: the quarterly Home Price Purchase Index, FHFA, and Case-Shiller (only the Case-Shiller index was weaker than expected, albeit up from the prior month). The second release of third-quarter GDP was the most notable indicator of the week with a much stronger than expected reading which showed the economy grew by 2.1% QoQ versus estimates of a 1.9% growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kick off December with another busy few days next week. Final November Markit and ISM numbers will kick off the week on Monday. While Markit is not expecting any change from the preliminary readings, ISM is expected to improve to 49.2 which would still be a contractionary print. In hard manufacturing data, later in the week we will see final durable and capital goods numbers for November. Vehicle sales figures will be the only release on Tuesday followed by the service counterparts to Markit and ISM indices on Wednesday as the rest of the week&amp;#39;s main focus will be on labor data. After a surprisingly strong release last month, Nonfarm Payrolls is again expecting a strong print showing 190K jobs created in the month of November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stocks To Be The Most Thankful For&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of the 25 best performing stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 so far in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tops the list with a gain of more than 100%. While no other S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks have yet to double this year, another semi name, Lam Research (LRCX) has come close with a gain of 99%. Xerox (XRX), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Target (TGT) have also all risen more than 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-2.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL) is the 19th best performing stock in the list above. But because of its trillion+ dollar market cap, Apple&amp;#39;s (AAPL) 69% gain has a much bigger impact on the overall stock market than all of the other stocks that have seen a bigger price move this year. In fact, of the S&amp;amp;P 500&amp;#39;s 25% price gain this year, Apple has accounted for 2.24 of those percentage points (or roughly 9%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at simple year-to-date price change, below is a list of the stocks that investors should be most thankful for this year because of their contribution to the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s gains. Right behind Apple (AAPL) in first is the other trillion+ dollar company -- Microsoft (MSFT) -- which has accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s 25% gain. After AAPL and MSFT are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Together these five mega-caps account for 25% of the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s move higher this year. While this group of companies has been vilified in 2019 for a number of things, they&amp;#39;re certainly still delivering for the stock market in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Industry Group Breadth Running Strong&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 may be hitting record highs at a pace of more than once every other day, but would you believe that there are still Industry Groups trading below their 50-day moving averages? The chart below shows the rolling percentage of Industry Groups trading above their 50-DMAs over the last several years, and the current reading stands at 91.7%. Over the last five years there have been numerous periods where a higher percentage (and even 100%) of Industry Groups traded above their 50-DMAs, and the most recent was back in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA-Chart.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So which are the two outlier groups that are still below their 50-DMAs? Well, when everyone seems to be taking an offensive posture in the market, it&amp;#39;s only natural that defensive sectors would be lagging, and two of the most defensive-oriented sectors in this yield-hungry world we live in are Utilities and Real Estate. Even these two groups, though, are only about 1% below their 50-DMAs, so all it will take is one or two good days for these groups to get them back over the hump. On the upside, Health Care Equipment &amp;amp; Services is the furthest above its 50-DMA at 7.72%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 as a whole is currently just over 4% above its 50-DMA. What&amp;#39;s interesting to note here, though, is that just 9 of the 24 Industry Groups are further above their 50-DMAs while 15 are not above their 50-DMAs by as much as the S&amp;amp;P 500. In terms of YTD returns, the S&amp;amp;P 500 is currently sitting on a gain of more than 25% YTD. Leading the way higher this year, Tech Hardware (Apple) has rallied just under 48%, while Semis are up just over 40%. Behind these two leaders, four other Industry Groups are up over 30% YTD. While there is no downside on a YTD basis, Energy has been the biggest laggard and is just barely hanging on to a YTD gain. If Energy can&amp;#39;t hang onto a YTD gain in a year where the S&amp;amp;P 500 gains more than 25%, Energy investors may need to wear paper bags over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Technology Sector P/E Highest in Ten Years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As equities run to all-time highs, valuations are at a fairly interesting point. As shown in the chart below using data from our Daily Sector Snapshot included with our Morning Lineup and The Closer, most sectors&amp;#39; valuations are at the upper end of the past ten years&amp;#39; range. Four sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Utilities, and Technology all have trailing P/E ratios in the 90th percentile or higher of the past ten years&amp;#39; readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the S&amp;amp;P 500 established its first all-time high since July on October 28th, Health Care and Financials have been two of the strongest performers rising 6.68% and 4.35%, respectively. Despite these runs, both of these sectors still have reasonable valuations relative to the past decade. For Financials, the current trailing price-to-earnings ratio is in the 42nd percentile of all days of the past ten years. No other sector has such a low reading although Materials and Energy are on the lower end relative to other sectors. On the other hand, Utilities and Technology have some of the highest valuations of the past ten years with the current P/E in the 97th and 99th percentiles, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the chart below, most of the last 9-12 months has seen valuations for Utilities consistently in the uppermost range of the past ten years as investors chased yield in a low interest rate environment. But as risk-free rates have risen more recently, valuations for Utilities have pulled back a bit as price has slid. While there have been other periods in the past ten years where Utilities&amp;#39; P/E ratio was similarly elevated, arguably only 2016/2017 saw it remain at the upper end of the ten-year range as consistently as has been the case this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Technology it is a whole different story. The P/E for the sector got crushed this time last year and after plummeting to the 31st percentile, it is has rebounded to the highest levels of the past ten years. The only other time that the sector traded at a similar premium relative to the past decade&amp;#39;s range was back in early 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Thanksgiving through Santa Claus Rally Trade&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is talking about yearend seasonal strength this year, but it’s not news to us. 2019 has been tracking historical seasonal market patterns quite closely this year and that suggests it is likely to continue to track it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our good friend Larry McMillan (@optstrategist) trades seasonal yearend strength with the Russell 2000 from the close the day before Thanksgiving through the end of our Santa Claus Rally (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we have run the numbers from 1979 when the Russell index data begins comparing R2K to the DJIA, S&amp;amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. The small-cap index Russell 2000 is the best performer up an average 3.1% (median 3.2%) with an 80% win ratio up 32 of the last 40 years. Last year was the worst and it’s been down 3 of the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://66.media.tumblr.com/7530bdceacb9ab4ad89d60e1bfa600c6/e574aa1a79d9670c-8e/s1280x1920/68c23f59d4bb7d3db3f2442c93e28fd6b34c1b43.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Giving Thanks for the U.S. Consumer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Thanksgiving, we’re thankful for solid consumer confidence, even though it has wavered in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November, according to preliminary Conference Board data. Even though the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has dropped from its economic cycle peak, consumer sentiment is still historically elevated, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/consumer-confidence_1.png?ssl=1""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been pleasantly surprised by the U.S. consumer’s resilience over the past year as other parts of the domestic economy have weakened amid global headwinds. Strong consumer spending has helped the economy grow at a 2% average rate over the past two quarters, despite drags on growth from business spending, inventories, and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Consumer sentiment has been largely immune from global headwinds,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect consumer spending to power economic growth through next year, so we’d like to see consumer confidence pick up more with signs of trade progress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers have several reasons to be optimistic. Employment is the primary driver of consumer health, and the U.S. labor market has been resilient. Wages are growing at a healthy rate, and consumers are reaping the benefits of tax cuts and record-high stock prices. As long as the job market stays solid and inflation remains in check, we feel good about consumers’ prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are growing signs of concern. While survey respondents have remained optimistic about present conditions, their outlook on future conditions has soured, according to the Conference Board. If consumers are feeling less confident about the future, they may be less inclined to spend and invest. That loss of confidence in the outlook could lead to economic weakness over time if consumers step back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, we would need to see more significant deterioration in consumer confidence before we would start to worry about the economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York added $108.95 billion in temporary liquidity to the financial system on Wednesday.

The intervention came in two parts. There were $87.95 billion in overnight repurchase agreements, or repos, and $21 billion in 15-day repos. The central bank took all the securities it was offered.

Fed repo interventions take in Treasury and mortgage securities from eligible banks in what is effectively a short-term loan of central-bank cash, collateralized by the securities.
The Fed has been intervening in markets in the current fashion since mid-September, when short-term rates unexpectedly shot up on a confluence of factors, although it has used similar operations for decades to manage short-term rates.

The Fed’s interventions are aimed at ensuring that the financial system has enough liquidity and that short- term borrowing rates remain well-behaved, with the central bank’s federal-funds rate staying within the 1.5%-to-1.75% target range. The effective fed-funds rate stood at 1.55% on Tuesday. The broad general collateral rate for repo trading stood at 1.51%, also for Tuesday.

Since the large interventions started, money-market rates have been well-behaved. The Fed is using temporary operations to tamp down on any possible volatility, while purchasing Treasury bills to build up reserves in the banking system. It hopes that by buying Treasury bills it will be able to cut back on repo interventions at the start of next year.

The Fed currently expects to buy Treasury bills through the middle of next year.

The reason I think it is a worthy WSB trade is it will pay out $9 if three of the late stage drugs Celgene had in trials are approved by about 2021.   It is a all or nothing trade, all three have to get approved.   So $20,900 turns into $90,000, a worthy YOLO imo.   BMY valued it at about $3.75 at the time of the merger and it is trading for $2.06 to $2.10 today.

What ideas do you have on this?

Here are mine:

Folder feature: Allow user to group a bunch of positions in a 'folder'. This way I can put my distant options / dividend paying safe stock in folders so i can focus on my week to week BS. Folder would display value of contents each day.
For example, I have to scroll past my CRON, CGC, PFE long positions that I'm not touching to find my SPY puts and weekly calls.



Dividend notification: when you receive dividends/coupons, display a treasure chest that the user clicks on and have the money jump out. This way you see your dividends happen. (Actual money is received in the normal way, the notification is just cooler)

Achievements: Add achievements for various things like getting 100, 200, 300, 1000 % gains also for owning various types of positions or executiing different trades. This will encourage people to learn about different kinds of cool things, like buying up BB- bonds. This way you can have a score (I have a ton of cool ideas for the achievements and would love to work with any brokerage that wants to consult with me on this idea)

FD YOLO Button: have automatic YOLO button where you enter a dollar amount, and your PRT, and it automatically buys liquid OTM options on something with an upcoming event expiring very soon within your stated PRT. (For example, if you have a $300 you can place a trade with a chance of getting $600 or zero w/o knowing the underlying stock)

Exercise button: Have a button/right click on options to excercize them.

Personal Loans: allow users to loan other users money and track defaults within app.

Automatic anti-retardation feature: allow users to lock themselves out of certain stocks for certain amounts of time to prevent doubling down on shitty stocks.

Have a weighted indicator of who is buying what:
Basically, using your annual returns, assign each user a score as to their Skills and PRT (sorta like a sharpe ratio) then if a bunch of people are buying a stock, lets us see if those people are autists who lose money or smart people who make money, this way we can follow the money makers.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I&amp;#39;ve been doing options for a while now, and I&amp;#39;ve thought of some features I would want Brokerages like Fidelity, Robinhood and Robinhood added.

I just discovered this GEM of a stock a few days ago.  It wasn't on my radar as it has very low volume which wouldn't trip on my scanner.  The way I came about it was because I had to go shopping for shoes and a friend recommended Shoe Carnival to me.  Now, I had heard of the company before but never really shopped there and didn't even know it was a public company.  I ended up getting a pair of sneakers there for dirt cheap but that wasn't what interested me.

I went back home and was curious so I dug up some info on the company and realized it was  traded.  Being an non-autistic WSBer, I researched the shit out of it the last few days and come to the conclusion that this is a MONSTER squeeze candidate in the making.  Just look at the numbers above.

With OVER 50% of the available shares shorted, and an extremely low float (only 9.1 million shares available), any major purchase of even a thousand shares is enough to move it like crazy.  The bid-ask spread on this the last few days is usually 0.5% or more because of such low liquidity.  This tells me that MM's and brokers won't be holding alot of this stock making gigantic moves more likely (ie. don't do market buys/sells!).  The last few trading days, the volume that is SHORT is above 10% of the total volume which has been steady.  This tells me that there is still a decent amount of short interest here (likely averaging UP) from existing shorts.

The earnings themselves beat AND raised.  The after hours movement the stock touched $40 but the day after it dropped back down (many factors, $FL reported earnings the morning which disappointed so sympathetic drop, more shorts piling on averaging UP to play a rip-bounce reversal).  The stock has seen a temporary rip generally in the mornings of 1-5% after the earnings only to reverse it all.  It's been holding steady as I believe it looks to be accumulation.  The company also has a buyback program with $19.1 million left on the books.  If they were to buy it all back today, it will reduce the float even more (another 500K shares).

On their latest earnings conference call, they mention they are well-insulated from tariffs as the majority of their inventory comes from Viet Nam which means no Trump-China BS affecting them (other than weak bagholders causing price to drop on selling).

Shoes may not interest the common WSB.  But given the numbers shown above, I can see this gapping slowly towards $50 in the next few weeks.  This suggests a potential 30% gain in the next month on a relatively safe bet.  Be warned though, that because of the low float, the daily movements in this stock may be stomach churning so my advice would be to buy it, forget it.  Hell, even set up some buy limit orders that is 1-2% below the price and you may be surprised that you can pick it up on random stop loss picking dips.

I'm personally in this one at an average of 35.88 @ 3400 shares.  I have firepower capital to buy another 4600 shares on dips.  I will be holding and selling at $50 if it hits.  I might sell 34 contracts of covered calls at either $40 or $45 for the Dec 20 monthly to protect myself a bit in case it has a random intraday dip, in which case I buy back the calls for a small discount.  Usually, the intraday dip corrects itself quickly and I will probably sell the same number of calls again.  Profiting on both dips and rips.

UPDATE: Checked the insider transactions.  Only 3 sells for all of 2019 for a total of $1 million USD.  Checked the job postings, over 3800 positions meaning they can handle that many more employee expenses.

UPDATE 2 (11/29): I pretty much called that dip didn't I ;)  And it pretty much corrected itself eh?  Hope the non-autists listened to me and got in on that dip.

&lt;p&gt;I just discovered this GEM of a stock a few days ago.  It wasn&amp;#39;t on my radar as it has very low volume which wouldn&amp;#39;t trip on my scanner.  The way I came about it was because I had to go shopping for shoes and a friend recommended Shoe Carnival to me.  Now, I had heard of the company before but never really shopped there and didn&amp;#39;t even know it was a public company.  I ended up getting a pair of sneakers there for dirt cheap but that wasn&amp;#39;t what interested me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back home and was curious so I dug up some info on the company and realized it was  traded.  Being an non-autistic WSBer, I researched the shit out of it the last few days and come to the conclusion that this is a MONSTER squeeze candidate in the making.  Just look at the numbers above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With OVER 50% of the available shares shorted, and an extremely low float (only 9.1 million shares available), any major purchase of even a thousand shares is enough to move it like crazy.  The bid-ask spread on this the last few days is usually 0.5% or more because of such low liquidity.  This tells me that MM&amp;#39;s and brokers won&amp;#39;t be holding alot of this stock making gigantic moves more likely (ie. don&amp;#39;t do market buys/sells!).

The users sold calls with very low strike price that were in the money. When you sell such a low strike call, you are essentially selling the security at market price. Take this instance, You buy $F is trading at $9.07 then turn around and sell $1 call with Dec 6 expiration you would receive the $8.07 premium so at expiration the option seller would receive $9.08 which is approximately the market price that the call seller bought the security for. Then regardless of what $F trading at option expiration, the seller profit is capped at approx ""$9.07"" the price they purchased the security for. 

Now even with the incorporation of margins and ""infinite leverage"" the user would net $0 profit at option expiration 

You can use an infinite series to model this at option expiration. So prior to expiration of the option your RH would look like Figure 1 where P=Initial Equity, 2 is RH max leverage ratio and n= number of times you the leverage trick. This is where you are seeing the crazy ""leveraging"", but at option expiration it follows models Figure 2 (condensed version is Figure 3) The sum of the series in figure 3 is 0, you net 0 profit at option expiration. You can leverage up and have your account LOOK as big as you want but at option expiration you would have netted nothing you are effectively back to where you began.

&lt;p&gt;The users sold calls with very low strike price that were in the money. When you sell such a low strike call, you are essentially selling the security at market price. Take this instance, You buy $F is trading at $9.07 then turn around and sell $1 call with Dec 6 expiration you would receive the $8.07 premium so at expiration the option seller would receive $9.08 which is approximately the market price that the call seller bought the security for. Then regardless of what $F trading at option expiration, the seller profit is capped at approx &amp;quot;$9.07&amp;quot; the price they purchased the security for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now even with the incorporation of margins and &amp;quot;infinite leverage&amp;quot; the user would net $0 profit at option expiration &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use an infinite series to model this at option expiration. So prior to expiration of the option your RH would look like Figure 1 where P=Initial Equity, 2 is RH max leverage ratio and n= number of times you the leverage trick. This is where you are seeing the crazy &amp;quot;leveraging&amp;quot;, but at option expiration it follows models Figure 2 (condensed version is Figure 3) The sum of the series in figure 3 is 0, you net 0 profit at option expiration. You can leverage up and have your account LOOK as big as you want but at option expiration you would have netted nothing you are effectively back to where you began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway last week i was in New York on the wallstreet. I wanted to take a pic with the charging bull but it was overwhelmed with asian tourists so I got mad and ordered an Uber.

The fare was $84, fine for the distance I was doing. Then the day after they had charged me with an ""adjusted my fare"" and pulled another $16 (how is that even legal) without a god damn notification, first warning sign. Then I click on the receipt because I was curious as to the specification to the $16.62 specific amount. The  receipt said ONLY:

In addition to other government-mandated taxes and fees, you'll also notice a new Congestion Surcharge on Manhattan trips below 96th St.

First thing, that's unfair as fuck. They knew the initiary before I booked which their algos could calculate into the price they offered even before i booked it. Secondly, where the fuck is the detailing of the specific 16 bucks u just nicked from my man purse??? Just that drives me nuts.

I kept searching for a reasoning for a (to me) huge difference in final price, people were like fees, tolls, traffic but all those were baked in into the first fee i paid with the $84 fare. So I was really curious how they calculated it so I contested the change and demanded a detailing of the fees (IT WASN'T EVEN DETAILED ON THE GOD DAMN RECEIPT HOW ILLEGAL ISN'T THAT).

Anyway, 3 hours later i get an answer. Guess what? A refund for $18, without any form of specification on the error (this to me is the last final warning sign).

And you ask me what are the warning signs leading up to? Well, that they do this intentionally. Unsuspecting customers or people that take this at face value: ""In addition to other government-mandated taxes and fees, you'll also notice a new Congestion Surcharge on Manhattan trips below 96th St."".

So this leads me to the numbers. They increased my fare by approx 20%. Say they use this technique on 1% of their users. And 30% of the users they pull this on suspect them and get refunded. This leads to the fact that their revenue is exaggerated by a crazy 0.001%. Knowing growth stocks are based on revenue growth that is unacceptable and I'm setting a price target at $0,2 per share.

Disney released Disney+ and Frozen these past few weeks and the earnings that came with them reflected only the costs and the hype that came with the releases. 

The coming year will see major revenue growth from the streaming app and an increase in the streaming library size. Bringing many who haven’t yet bought Disney+ into the Disney fold.

Some support for the growing Disney brand is the park operation. I’m currently at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, FL and was at Universal Studio yesterday. Both parks (and I’m assuming EPCOT as well) are undergoing expansion/construction in their resort areas probably to accommodate an increase in park attendance. Not only this, but Disney has opened its newest theme park expansion Star Wars: Galaxies Edge which has yet to prove its profit generation. Coupled with Disney’s series The Mandalorian, the show will very likely drive up park attendance at the new theme park.

All in all, 2020 will prove to be a massive year for Disney’s parks and it’s streaming service. If you haven’t bought in a dip yet, do so before the next earnings because it will most definitely be big. If not, that will be due to construction costs at the parks and will be the centrally planned dip to make good earnings nonconsecutive and generate larger positive shifts in price.

Anyways, that’s been my Thanksgiving DD, enjoy the holidays and don’t stop betting on wallstreet, my fellow autists.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just some light dd reading for your holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been studying the wildlife of wallstreetbets for a number of years. The sophistication is near zero save for a few of the critters that inhabit this desolate land. It’s incredibly cutthroat and for those that do survive the initial shock still get beaten down by the more senior wildlife.

Our primary groups are split up into three separate but very similar factions: Bear, Bull, and Theta Gang. 

Bear gang is almost always asleep. When the overall landscape gets a little uncomfortable they awake for a few minutes, only to go back into hybernation for a few more decades. 

When they do awake, they let out a terrible scream that sounds something like “SPY puts because I’m a filthy commie” or “I have bearish DD on AAPL and MSFT”, but these bears are short lived and typically get slaughtered after awakening,

Bull gang, the overly optimistic and always awake. Bull gang herds are much larger than bear gang herds. This is partially due to the fact bulls will typically go with the flow and not overcomplicate life. If the harvest is strong, bull gang is in. Bull gang is simple yet much more successful than bears.

Theta gang. 

The most hated yet most respected gang on this degenerate plane. Unlike the simple bulls and bears, theta gang takes no form. Theta gang exists simply because the universe exists. While the bulls and bears have relatively short lifespans theta gang is eternal. 

Theta gang thrives on the minimalist approach. As long as time passes, then theta gang is alive,

Day trade gang:

They swing their 25k+ around like it’s nothing. They enter and exit trades that bear and bull gang can only dream of.

Technical analysis gang:

So I ended up reading all of the articles in regards to Lumateperone's usage for treating schizophrenia. It seems like Lumateperone has a very good dopamine d2 receptor occupancy level (rivals that of Clozapine, one of the best anti-psychotic drugs on the market) and the 60 mg oral daily dose has shown efficacy in two of the three randomized phase 3 trials. After finishing up the phase 3 studies, the FDA canceled the Adcom on Lumateperone's candidacy for schizophrenia and simply asked the company for animal toxicology studies. As it turns out, the molecule has an impeccable safety profile (it was optimized by med chemists at BMS) and these animal tox studies further supported that. But because Wall Street is obsessed with how adcom meetings can lead to stocks running high, a cancellation of an adcom was a bad sign for them and the stock got punished. Since the molecule had subpar performance in the previous phase 3 studies for its efficacy for treating bipolar disorder, I think that people were simply tired of this stock and thought it wasnt gonna go anywhere.

In my opinion, the FDA is very busy with packing all these meetings into its calendar and they realized that Lumateperone has an excellent safety profile and decided to simply ask for some supplemental information as opposed to having a whole meeting about the drug's safety. While the molecule did not show much efficacy in previous phase 3 studies, it seems like it actually has good performance against schizophrenia. Given that Karuna just got some great price boost from its phase 2 results, I think the market may react nicely to this potential approval.

From an insider perspective, there hasnt been any recent insider selling. There's a director that has bought over 6 million dollars worth of shares recently, and ITCI has been hiring a lot recently. Most of the people that were hired started working at October of 2019, interestingly. All of those who were hired are in the business/sales/growth of the company, showing that the company is anticipating an approval and is trying to set up a platform for growing their product.

There's quite a lot of short interest on this stock, and I believe that this is due to people thinking that this approval is gonna get rejected much like all the other previous approvals in regards to ITCI's Lumateperone. I have  calls on this, but to cover the premiums on them, I bought some puts on the off chance that the approval doesn't go through. Thus, my worst case scenario is that I won't lose any money, but if the drug does get approved, we might see a huge gain since market reacted quite nicely to Karuna recently. This is my DD on ITCI.

On the one hand, you have all these /investing and Boggleheads and even some folks on /wsb saying, ""if you have a 30 year horizon, just hold like you hold your penis while typing comments on pornhub.""

On the other, other hand, you have the 1970s 'n shit, or Japan since the early 90s, which went sideways for decades...shouldn't we at least do SOMETHING active to prevent loss?

So...yeah - maybe withdrawing a shitload into cash as shit gets hotter and hotter makes sense, right?

Just holding onto a general market ETF feels really retarded when it's generally accepted that things will go down a large amount at some point in the next let's say...year or maybe at least three years?

I first started my trading journey around 16 months ago. I took out a loan and had an initial capital of 800 dollars, had absolutely no previous experience and started with Robinhood. Within a month I had around 30k dollars and was pretty damn happy. Afterwards things started going downhill after I tried messing with SNAP options and it definitely took me awhile to get back my edge.

At this point, I finally feel confident that I've got what it takes. I've learned the basics, developed my instincts, have a game plan when I open a trade, basically, I got my shit together. I've taken a couple months break to also reflect on any mistakes I might have been making.

So that's why I'm making this little bet with WSB, the bet is I will be able to make 100 Milion dollars in one year (or less) from the date of this post. If I win this bet, the first 50 people who comment on this post will get 500 bucks. If I lose, then I'll do something embarrassing, not sure what yet ( suggestions from  u/stormwillpass  are welcome).

P.S: I know the chances of this happening aren't huge but I (like many of you) believe I am **the one** who will succeed where so many have failed.

Edit: Due to the (somewhat unexpected) support, positivity and overall wholesomeness I'm changing this to if I win, the first 100 people to comment get 500 bucks. You guys rock.

Would have been up 1000% if I sold at its peak today :( all the strike prices up to $210 as far as a month out, are up more than 150% right now

Think its dumb to FOMO into it? Been watching this bitch grow for a month

At least I got some ARWR tendies, but, sold those too earlier like a true fucking autist as well

I think I am gonna be gay and stick my money into SPY and other funds, dollar cost averaging by buying shares each month and only do a YOLO once in awhile. This options shit is stressful.

Background: I am the lead hedge fund manager at the local Denny's

While analyzing ford I Realized that Ford's stock price has relative sell-offs at consolidated places. If you open up the MACD and a 1-month chart you can see the pattern and trend. The volume sold is also much higher than expected. Ive noticed these trends happen over a week frame so lets say you time the MACD and oscillator and buy Ford stock at $8.50. you wait 6 days and see that the MACD is showing bearish signs so you sell against for $9. You've just made $.50 a share. 

If you were to invest $100 into this you would have a quick 5% gain in a week. I tested my theory out yesterday Bought at $8.83 and sold at $9.05 today.

This is Vlad Tenev, for those who aren't aware. He looks like he just got out of a bong-ripping competition at the local dispensary and sells extra-strength edibles to your local high school freshmen. 2 things occurred to me as I found out what this dude actually looks like:

1. It's highly likely he has no idea wtf he's doing.
2. You're a literal retard if you trust this half-baked manchild to safeguard your money.

Also, I have this sneaking suspicion his Indian partner Baiju Bhatt likely did most of the programming for the platform. But even he looks like he just spent 3 weeks straight tripping balls on a volkswagon van somewhere in middle America.

So why did Schwab dropped commissions to zero recently?

&lt;p&gt;So why did Schwab dropped commissions to zero recently?

However, this is something you do not want to do; you are better off just selling the calls. You will see this if you just calculate the profit between selling the call versus exercising and selling the stock. I thought I'd illustrate why.

Start with put-call parity:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put%E2%80%93call_parity

- C = price of call
- P = price of put
- S = market price of the stock
- X = strike price of the option
- PV(X) = present value of the strike price of the option

P + S = C + PV(X)

Re-arrange to solve for the price of a call:

C = P + S - PV(X)

Now, you can look at intrinsic value of the option; this is the value you get from exercising and selling the stock; this is the difference between buying the stock at the strike price and selling it at the market price (i.e. S-X). To add that to the expression above, we can both add and subtract X (to keep the equation balanced):

C = (S-X) + P + [X - PV(X)]

The first term (S-X) represents the intrinsic value. This is all you would get from exercising the call and selling the stock. However, as you can see, the actual option has additional value.

You get value from the built in downside protection - the value of the put (P). In addition, you get additional value from the interest you save by buying a call and deferring your purchase of stock into the future instead of purchasing the stock now [X - PV(X)].

TLDR: You should not exercise a call option early because of the value remaining from the built in downside protection and value of the interest savings. If you want to exit the position and don't want to hold until maturity, you are better off just selling the option. This is a good tool to help you determine what you should buy/sell your options for:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C = price of call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P = price of put&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S = market price of the stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X = strike price of the option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PV(X) = present value of the strike price of the option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P + S = C + PV(X)&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a good story. I’ve been watching $UNIT for half a year now since someone else posted a trade about it. I’ve continually bought into this stock as it goes lower and lower and lower and I think that, after my countless attempts to catch a falling knife, it’s finally bottomed out.

Uniti group is a REIT that constructs and acquires communications infrastructure through fiber, towers and leasing. They are a spin-off of Windstream Holdings. 

In order to understand what’s going on I have to start with who Windstream is. Windstream [is a provider of voice and data network communications](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windstream_Holdings) in predominantly rural areas. Windstream was and is a growing and profitable business. In 2015, Windstream decided to create a spin-off REIT in a move that would allow them to [reduce more than $4 billion in debt and increase network investments](https://investor.uniti.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windstream-board-directors-gives-final-approval-reit-spinoff-and). This was a pretty good move on their part as it freed up capital to continue making network investments and gave Windstream share holders a quarterly .25 cent dividend. It also allowed Uniti (then CS&amp;L) to operate as an independent company. This was also good for the newly formed Uniti as some of the sale-leasebacks [have almost 100% margins](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/05/09/uniti-group-inc-unit-q1-2019-earnings-call-transcr.aspx). This is all good and well for except for two things: One, Uniti’s income now was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified and two, this spin-off [tripped bond indentures](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-loses-legal-case-against-hedge-fund-aurelius-and-now-is-stuck-with-a-huge-bill-51550318739) meaning Windstream was now in default of issued bonds. This wasn’t an issue with most bond holders as they would be happy getting paid out when the bonds matured. Enter Aurelius Capital Management.

Aurelius Capital Management is a hedge fund operated by Mark Brodsky, a former bankruptcy lawyer. This is a ruthless man who is driven solely by profit and money and I’ll be goddamned if that’s not the way God intended things to be. This is the same man who [attempted to force the government of Argentina to pay 1.3 Billion following the 2010 Argentinian default on debt.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-01-14/aurelius-capital-sues-argentina-over-gdp-linked-securities). They’re vultures, gotta respect the hustle. Anyway, in 2017, a couple years after the Windstream/Unit spin-off, Aurelius buys up 25% of Windstream’s 2023 Bonds, then hits up the local CDS (Credit Default Swap, yes like The Big Short) market and gets a handful of those. The CDS will pay out if Windstream ever misses a payment on its debt. Then they walk back over to Windstream and say hey, your spin-off of assets violated bond covenants and we want to accelerate the payments of these notes. You owe us full repayment plus interest, approximately 310 Million. Windstream, being the reasonable company they are, say hey we can’t pay that, we don’t have the capital for that, that will bankrupt us. Plus, we didn’t violate bond covenants. Windstream is pretty confident that they didn’t violate bond covenants but just in case, they issue more notes in order to dilute Aurelius’s bond holdings down to 6.25% of the 2023’s, they try and retroactively get waivers from other bond holders and they visit **TWO** different law firms, both which say, Nah, you’re good bruh. You didn’t violate bond covenants. Subsequently, the stock price that had fallen to $2 per share rises to $7 per share over the course of the next few months. The Aurelius lawsuit was within the market's Personal Risk Tolerance. 

On February 25th, 2019, Judge Jesse Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rules that Windstream did, in fact, violate bond covenants when it spun off its fiber-optic cable business into Uniti. This caught everyone by surprise except Bid Dick Aurelius who is now awarded 310.5 Million and *will get paid out by the CDS it had*. What happened next is pretty brutal. Windstream immediately filed for a chapter 11 bankruptcy, watched its stock become a penny stock and has top executives [claiming market manipulation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-files-for-bankruptcy-calls-for-credit-default-swap-regulation-51551133206). To which Aurelius responds, and I quote, “Windstream’s accusation of market manipulation is nonsense,” says an Aurelius spokesperson. “Rather than whining about us and Judge Furman, Windstream’s management and board should engage in much-needed introspection.” Basically, suck it up pussies.

You’re probably wondering how this relates to Unit by now. Well, remember when I told you that Uniti’s revenue was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified? Well, they didn’t diversify quick enough. Windstream still accounts for 64% of Uniti’s revenue, which means when the ruling went against Windstream, Uniti’s stock price went down with it. To make matters worse, Windstream is looking to recharacterize a $650 million-per-year lease agreement with spinoff REIT Uniti Group Inc. as a disguised financing arrangement that siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars away from them. They’re saying that the lease was never actually a lease but a financing deal. They’re trying to claw back millions in payments in order to free up cash flow and get billions back in assets which are no longer theirs. This claim is artificially holding down Uniti’s stock price, as a ruling for Windstream could mean Uniti loses $650 million per year in the lease revenue. Here’s where we finally get to the trade. I believe that Uniti and Windstream will never even get to the court date that’s planned in March of 2020. Today, November 25th, a [summary of judgement](http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000010) was entered along with the supporting [memorandum of law](http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000011). This essentially holds Uniti’s lawyers’ arguments about dismissing Windstream’s ridiculous attempt to recharacterize the lease as financing. It has compelling arguments and since I know you won’t read it, I’ll try and summarize the strongest argument.

In order for Windstream to spin Unit into a REIT and gain the tax-advantage status while also maximizing both companies values, they had to ensure that the lease was a “true lease.” Windstream structured it like that. They also pitched it like that when selling Uniti securities to creditors and investors that traded Windstream debt and equity for Uniti’s. Windstream further claims that Windstream’s structural peculiarities somehow render the lease an unsecured and structurally subordinated financing. This would be news to Uniti’s investors, who purchased Uniti securities based on Windstream’s representations that Uniti owned that property and received rent payments from Windstream under a true lease.

Basically they would’ve intentionally misled potential creditors and investors. As a result I believe that on or around December 18th, 2019, Honorable Robert D. Drain will grant summary judgement in favor of Uniti, dismissing all claims of recharacterization the Master Lease as financing. This will remove all uncertainty from Uniti, will require that Windstream assume the Master lease unchanged and will also result in $UNIT trading at or around $20 by January 20th, 2020. 

Therefore, I suggest you get 5/15 - $10 Calls. They’re fairly cheap.


TL;DR: 5/15/20 $UNIT Calls

Edit: Also, I checked Aurelius’s 13F to look at their holdings. Here’s the kicker. They only hold two stocks, $AGO and $UNIT. They added to their position almost a half million shares.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright you paint huffers, try to get through this. It’s a good story. I’ve been watching $UNIT for half a year now since someone else posted a trade about it. I’ve continually bought into this stock as it goes lower and lower and lower and I think that, after my countless attempts to catch a falling knife, it’s finally bottomed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniti group is a REIT that constructs and acquires communications infrastructure through fiber, towers and leasing. They are a spin-off of Windstream Holdings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand what’s going on I have to start with who Windstream is. Windstream &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windstream_Holdings""&gt;is a provider of voice and data network communications&lt;/a&gt; in predominantly rural areas. Windstream was and is a growing and profitable business. In 2015, Windstream decided to create a spin-off REIT in a move that would allow them to &lt;a href=""https://investor.uniti.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windstream-board-directors-gives-final-approval-reit-spinoff-and""&gt;reduce more than $4 billion in debt and increase network investments&lt;/a&gt;. This was a pretty good move on their part as it freed up capital to continue making network investments and gave Windstream share holders a quarterly .25 cent dividend. It also allowed Uniti (then CS&amp;amp;L) to operate as an independent company. This was also good for the newly formed Uniti as some of the sale-leasebacks &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/05/09/uniti-group-inc-unit-q1-2019-earnings-call-transcr.aspx""&gt;have almost 100% margins&lt;/a&gt;. This is all good and well for except for two things: One, Uniti’s income now was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified and two, this spin-off &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-loses-legal-case-against-hedge-fund-aurelius-and-now-is-stuck-with-a-huge-bill-51550318739""&gt;tripped bond indentures&lt;/a&gt; meaning Windstream was now in default of issued bonds. This wasn’t an issue with most bond holders as they would be happy getting paid out when the bonds matured. Enter Aurelius Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aurelius Capital Management is a hedge fund operated by Mark Brodsky, a former bankruptcy lawyer. This is a ruthless man who is driven solely by profit and money and I’ll be goddamned if that’s not the way God intended things to be. This is the same man who &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-01-14/aurelius-capital-sues-argentina-over-gdp-linked-securities""&gt;attempted to force the government of Argentina to pay 1.3 Billion following the 2010 Argentinian default on debt.&lt;/a&gt;. They’re vultures, gotta respect the hustle. Anyway, in 2017, a couple years after the Windstream/Unit spin-off, Aurelius buys up 25% of Windstream’s 2023 Bonds, then hits up the local CDS (Credit Default Swap, yes like The Big Short) market and gets a handful of those. The CDS will pay out if Windstream ever misses a payment on its debt. Then they walk back over to Windstream and say hey, your spin-off of assets violated bond covenants and we want to accelerate the payments of these notes. You owe us full repayment plus interest, approximately 310 Million. Windstream, being the reasonable company they are, say hey we can’t pay that, we don’t have the capital for that, that will bankrupt us. Plus, we didn’t violate bond covenants. Windstream is pretty confident that they didn’t violate bond covenants but just in case, they issue more notes in order to dilute Aurelius’s bond holdings down to 6.25% of the 2023’s, they try and retroactively get waivers from other bond holders and they visit &lt;strong&gt;TWO&lt;/strong&gt; different law firms, both which say, Nah, you’re good bruh. You didn’t violate bond covenants. Subsequently, the stock price that had fallen to $2 per share rises to $7 per share over the course of the next few months. The Aurelius lawsuit was within the market&amp;#39;s Personal Risk Tolerance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 25th, 2019, Judge Jesse Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rules that Windstream did, in fact, violate bond covenants when it spun off its fiber-optic cable business into Uniti. This caught everyone by surprise except Bid Dick Aurelius who is now awarded 310.5 Million and &lt;em&gt;will get paid out by the CDS it had&lt;/em&gt;. What happened next is pretty brutal. Windstream immediately filed for a chapter 11 bankruptcy, watched its stock become a penny stock and has top executives &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-files-for-bankruptcy-calls-for-credit-default-swap-regulation-51551133206""&gt;claiming market manipulation&lt;/a&gt;. To which Aurelius responds, and I quote, “Windstream’s accusation of market manipulation is nonsense,” says an Aurelius spokesperson. “Rather than whining about us and Judge Furman, Windstream’s management and board should engage in much-needed introspection.” Basically, suck it up pussies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re probably wondering how this relates to Unit by now. Well, remember when I told you that Uniti’s revenue was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified? Well, they didn’t diversify quick enough. Windstream still accounts for 64% of Uniti’s revenue, which means when the ruling went against Windstream, Uniti’s stock price went down with it. To make matters worse, Windstream is looking to recharacterize a $650 million-per-year lease agreement with spinoff REIT Uniti Group Inc. as a disguised financing arrangement that siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars away from them. They’re saying that the lease was never actually a lease but a financing deal. They’re trying to claw back millions in payments in order to free up cash flow and get billions back in assets which are no longer theirs. This claim is artificially holding down Uniti’s stock price, as a ruling for Windstream could mean Uniti loses $650 million per year in the lease revenue. Here’s where we finally get to the trade. I believe that Uniti and Windstream will never even get to the court date that’s planned in March of 2020. Today, November 25th, a &lt;a href=""http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000010""&gt;summary of judgement&lt;/a&gt; was entered along with the supporting &lt;a href=""http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000011""&gt;memorandum of law&lt;/a&gt;. This essentially holds Uniti’s lawyers’ arguments about dismissing Windstream’s ridiculous attempt to recharacterize the lease as financing. It has compelling arguments and since I know you won’t read it, I’ll try and summarize the strongest argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I suggest you get 5/15 - $10 Calls. They’re fairly cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

About a 2 years ago, they fell due to the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, but held together a lot better than the failing Mattel, and were much better at shifting over to Target, Walmart and Amazon than others in the segment. Over this year, they surged from ~85 to ~120 off the back of Magic the Gathering's new digital ""Magic Arena"". Then, last quarter, they crashed back due to trade war bullshit, completely disregarding the continuing growth of Magic Arena and the upcoming release of Frozen 2.
&gt; 
&gt; Frozen 1 was an absurdly huge success. Disney was caught flatfooted for that and brought Hasbro on as a partner for their toy lines pretty late to the party, but it still literally doubled Hasbro's ""girl toys"" sales for the year. This time, Hasbro and Disney have been partnered from the beginning and have already gotten every store to push Frozen 2 toys since the beginning of the month. If Frozen 2 delivers even a reasonable fraction of Frozen 1's success, Hasbro's gonna pop off.
&gt; 
&gt; This is like... anti-priced in.

&gt; &gt; I bought a 4/17 $97.5 - $105 call spread when it dropped, and a 4/17 $95 call as soon as it dipped below 95, which turned out to be near the bottom. Because of yesterday's little run-up, I opened a pretty optimistic 1/17 $100, closed the $105 call and a closed a short-dated call against my 100 shares (both of those at a small loss, but I'm increasingly optimistic now that things are moving due to Yoda/Disney+). No plans on opening more positions, time to just ride it out until good news hits. Might even pussy out of one of those positions if this run continues. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In other words, I'm doing both, but I think the gain train has already left the station and I'm not going to chase after it. You'll have to come up with something on your own if you wanna get in.

Those claims are relatively easy to check from the various quarterly conference calls over the last 5 years or so, or you can trust a stranger on the internet.

Anyway, $HAS was up 2% yesterday and is already up another 1% premarket today, [Baby Yoda toys confirmed](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/baby-yoda-toys/index.html), and as I said earlier MTG Arena and Frozen 2 have been in their sights for a good long time now.

You see all those ~~murder and execution~~ merger and acquisition news . And you think, damn, I wish I bought MDCO calls last week . MDCO buyout price is 85 and it's about 84 now . You can buy MDCP for 84 and wait until execution to get your $1 of gain. You would have to put in plenty of capital now to get the measly 1.5% gain in some distant future

Or

You can sell puts. March 2020 80P goes for 0.55 per contract.  Sell 10 and it's 550 in your account. You don't put any capital in , it's all against your margin (how deep in debt your broker allows you to go) . Make that unlimited leverage in RH produce some cold cash . Now, not somewhere later. Even with 1 contract , it's $55 on $0 money in.

Is there any risk, you ask . Well, if the deal falls through  (e.g. AVGO buying QCOM ) the stock plunges and you get exercised ( they call it ""assigned"", but you would feel it more like ass-exercised ) you will make analfarmer proud. But seriously, it has to be hostile takeover attempt like it was AVGO-QCOM disaster.

My dad has a small portfolio but during lunch one day he asked me about options so I went on a rant about them and he was intrigued, to say the least, but I really didn’t think much of it. While he’s at work one day he sends me a screenshot of his first options trade ever. As many of you well know it expired dogshit worthless and now he just sent me another screenshot of a trade he wants to get in which is 265 Apple calls this Friday.

The bottom line is I’m thinking inverse every trade my dad makes. If I would have inversed his OTM Uber put gamble I would be sitting on 200% gains.

Haupt is known as an established player in the market, having enjoyed steady karma revenues quarter to quarter from his consistently high quality gif submissions. Haupt's brand enjoys similar type of loyalty as $AAPL, thanks to gifs that are guaranteed to make you chuckle, with quotes such as ""Beyond Meat? Isn't that a lesbian book club?” or random clips of copulating chimpanzees. The market is far from a monopoly though - with new entrants such as /u/Bipedal-Moose, with his memorable ""[Field of Tendies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/diunpo/field_of_tendies/)"". Over time it’s becoming clear that high quality alone is not enough for /u/haupt91 to distinguish his work - particularly given the generally half-witted population of /r/wallstreetbets who might underappreciate subtle differences between authors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disruption**

Just over two weeks ago /u/haupt91, following in the footsteps of Steve Jobs (iPad) and Jeff ""Lex Luthor"" Bezos (Kindle), unveiled a new category of a shitpost to the sub - one that does away with the sweet benefits of anonymity in the name of fame among the imbeciles visiting this cursed corner of the internet. With the [WSB YOLO King](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dtf7s0/wsb_yolo_king_lands_interview_on_cnbc/), /u/haupt91 has started a new era of /r/wallstreetbets \- the era of vlogging.

&amp;#x200B;

**Origins**

Until recently, /r/wallstreetbets members preferred not to show their likely unappealing faces - that is until /u/ControlTheNarrative changed the game with his legendary [I recorded today's market-open and the instant delta to my portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/) post. His brave move was rewarded with multiple reddit-coin badges, including the $100 dollar “Golden Fuckboy” and 3x GAY awards. The rawness of the video, culminating in the now-famous guttural “guh” sound, puts it firmly in the snuff-film category of /r/wallstreetbets hall of fame. It’s worth noting that /u/ControlTheNarrative didn’t set off to create a meme, or at least seemed to be taken off guard by its popularity. And thus, he quickly lost control of it, with derivative memes coming close to outshining the original - for example u/Orgasimo’s [Say Something I'm GUHving Up on You](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dr3eki/say_something_im_guhving_up_on_you_official_music/). This is in contrast to /u/haupt91 who so far hasn't inspired ""re-mixes"" of his work, but has been much more deliberate in building and controlling his brand.

&amp;#x200B;

**WSBloggers**

The latest stage of diversification of the /r/wallstreetbets meme economy is represented by u/Dejula’s post - [“Watch the downfall of Dejula”](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e01t9k/watch_the_downfall_of_dejula/). He skillfully weaved his humorous comments into a clip that on the surface was nothing more than a video version of a loss pic. The budget of the video was approximately $45k - highlighting barriers to entry for potential /r/wallstreetbets vloggers. By my estimates, a vlogger could have a good shot at disrupting the current market with a budget of approx $100k - this would enable five $20k YOLOs (amount that’s likely to attract attention) which could be spread over two quarters. It is my strong belief that u/Dejula's video will be remembered as one of the first real /r/wallstreetbets vlogs. He understood that numpties frequenting /r/wallstreetbets have no time for classic youtube-style vloggers, who rarely put their balls on the line - although I have no doubt that many will try to record PG-rated /r/wallstreetbets commentary vlogs, where no money is put at risk.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusions**

I believe this time next year we will have have several established shitposters specialising in video content. With 741k subscribers on /r/wallstreetbets, the addressable audience is large enough to wonder why this hasn’t happened earlier. It’s worth noting that due to high barriers to entry, monetisation won’t be the goal of those shitposters - but lack of monetisation hasn’t dissuaded thousands from visiting this Aleppo of investment forums every day.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/haupt91""&gt;/u/haupt91&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;started what I believe will be the next big thing on this sub - for better or for worse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But you stick to it and keep buying FD after FD in hopes of maximum tendies, and we salute you for that.

But what if you’re trying to do gay stuff like “manage your risk,” and make consistent returns from buying options? Well you’re in luck, because I have a strategy for you that literally cannot go tits in an upwards fashion and will lead you to the promised land of tendies.

1.) You must manage your risk. Your portfolio should not be entirely options. In fact, your portfolio should be anything less than 1.8% options. The rest of your money should be in this thing called a “high yield savings account.” Find one of these that has 1.8% interest or better, and let your reserve cash just sit in there. By year end, that account will have 1.8% gains just doing nothing!

2.) with your options account, you should be avoiding risky strategies such as but not limited to: long OTM FD’s, etc. The best option strategy you can employ is going long $CASH LEAP’s. A LEAP is an option with a long expiry. So basically you buy a cash leap by just going long on your cash and letting it sit there until expiry, but unlike other options, $CASH LEAP’s can’t expire worthless and are immune to theta decay, so you keep all your tendies!

3.) If you’ve employed this strategy correctly, even the most autistic of you should be making consistent returns. Hell, you may even ball out and make 2% a year if the fed decides to raise interest rates at any point. You are now making more than 90% of the users on this sub, congrats, you are now in the options trading elite.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you new guys coming from &lt;a href=""/r/all""&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; or somewhere else may be shocked when you come to the realization that most everyone here is losing money on a regular basis.

Snapchat is trading off its 200 day.

Twitter drop was due to a bug effecting the targeting effectiveness of their advertisements. Ad revenue is 90% of their business, so that's why investors freaked. This was a one time event that imo is an easy fix for the short-term.

$TWTR is actually profitable since 2018 and has 50% more monthly active users over $SNAP --- that by the way is at a market cap of 21B while twitter is at 23B.  So these two companies are basically worth the same to investors as it stands right now. 

If you ask me Twitter more strongly reflects a company like FB than it does Snapchat. And FB currently trades  at a P/e ratio around 31. Twitter's p/e is around half that at 14. 

I love using Snapchat but their business model is trash, everything they do gets copied by other platforms i/e Instagram stories. They're not a news outlet or a place to find information like twitter, monetizing off lens filters is a joke.

Last week stonk consolidated, affirmed mid 140s. If we look at this week we see HK had pro dem elections. China hasn’t rolled the tanks in... yet. China still wants a deal w Daddy.

Ferengi Rules of Acquisition


Once you have their money, you never give it back.

The best deal is the one that brings the most profit.

Never spend more for an acquisition than you have to.

A woman wearing clothes is like a man in the kitchen.

Never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity.

Keep your ears open.

Small print leads to large risk.

Opportunity plus instinct equals profit.

Greed is eternal.

Even if it's free, you can always buy it cheaper.

Anything worth doing is worth doing for money.

Anything worth doing is worth doing twice.

Keep your family close, keep your Latinum closer.

A deal is a deal. (until a better one comes along).

A contract is a contract is a contract (but only between Ferengi).

A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all.

Satisfaction is not guaranteed.

Only give money to people you know you can steal from.

Never place friendship above profit.

Never place friendship before profit.

A wise man can hear profit in the wind.

Latinum can't buy happiness, but you can sure have a blast renting it.

There's always a way out.

As the customers go, so goes the wise profiteer.

There's nothing more dangerous than an honest businessman.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought this might be a good topic to spitball about. I&amp;#39;ll post just the first few.&lt;/p&gt;

Next round of hikes set for early 2020

China is giving some bullshit promise that strokes Mango here [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/china-to-raise-penalties-on-ip-rights-violations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/china-to-raise-penalties-on-ip-rights-violations)

2 ways this can work out, either Mango takes the bait and cancels or reduces next tariffs hike or shit proceeds as before.

Either way there is going to be an impact on the ocean shipping industry. Import/exports waiting to be shipped gotta be getting front loaded in expectation of the outcome and we are getting close. So, either companies ship a fuckton when the deal goes through or ship a fuckton and pass the cost on to the consumer, since they still gotta make dem tendies to resupply the inventory post shopping season.

My plan right now is to try to figure out who is been holding out on inventory restock and what shippers they use then try  to play some FDs like a ~~chump~~ champ off of that.

Anyone done something similar? I am broke as fuck, so no Bloomberg terminal access to see where shippers are or supply chain data.

The thing with pickup trucks is that they're a huge market in the US, but let's face it 99% of truck people would not want to switch to electric as long as gasoline exists.

The Rivian, and big three electric pickups will sell in very low volumes (forget Amazon for a second). If Tesla had made a more normal-looking truck, it would have had a small share of a small sub-section of that market (aka electric pickup trucks).

Now this design is a much smarter way to approach it:

-not many people would've bought an electric Tesla pickup anyway, but now in addition to some of those people, other people may consider buying it. People who may not even need a truck, but who want to get it just for the badassery of the thing, or its originality. Or the low cost alone may attract buyers who would not have considered buying a pickup in the first place. A big deterrent to buying a truck is the fuel cost, but since electric motors are so efficient it's less of a concern.

-another thing to consider is I'm pretty sure this design has some super-efficient engineering benefits behind it, AKA they'll be able to make a good profit off of it, even at a low price. Less parts probably and other things. Which would have been more difficult with a more traditional-style truck.

-this unique styling is something that sticks in your mind. I remember at first I hated the design, then it stuck in my mind all day. I still don't think it's superb, but now when I look at every other vehicle including the Rivian or other teslas they look out of date. And after having this thought I saw people making posts about that same observation. Unbelievable...

-the last thing to consider is this got people talking about Tesla, huge amounts of free advertising, which will drive other model sales.

So yeah. I think there's way much more to this than just ""haha we made a cybertruck from the future""...

You small brains who keep commenting how retarded automation is in convoys have small pp and need to think what the technology &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do and not just the idea of a fucking automated convoy, ree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, you can play spades and dip while the convoy happens automatically. 👌&lt;/p&gt;

[Disney +] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Disney%2B#Upcoming_original_programming) vs. [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix).

My central thesis is that the release of Disney + will only serve to retroactively contextualize and reinforce Netflix's strategy of vast, ongoing investment in their original programming and act as the perfect foil against which Netflix can finally be compared to reveal just how ahead of the competition it truly is. I may say some disparaging things about Disney, but that in no way reflects my opinion on the direction of their stock - I am only commenting on Netflix here. 

Now, I tend to get long-winded in my writing, but I'm not trying to submit an essay for you degenerates so here are some draft bullets:

-	Netflix has done so much cool shit with their releases in the past, but it’s always gone under the radar or not been fully appreciated. Does anyone remember when they showed the trailer for Cloverfield: Paradox at the Superbowl, and it was available to watch right after? I remember thinking how much of a flex that was to the entire industry, realizing that no other company was positioned or even capable of doing something similar. Whether its movies, television, premium subscriptions, or streaming content - the current model is entrenched in the process by which it is monetized, which is to say that it is deliberately slow and hinges on the hype and anticipation of a release to ensure a return (sponsorships, advertising, product placement, IP, merchandising, etc). Game of Thrones comes to mind here for several reasons, not the least of which is that I started this bullet by mentioning Cloverfield, and both were series with promising beginnings that ended in pointless dogshit. However, in the case of Cloverfield: Paradox, Netflix was able to give it that type of a release and look good regardless of the movie’s reception. That’s a supreme flex, but if you’re already the biggest dude in the gym, you’re just alone straining your biceps in front of a mirror. Netflix Miyagi needed its own Cobra Kai so that next time it beats up a bunch of teenagers in an alley after a Halloween party, the viewing public knows who to look to and say, “Ooooooh shit, you gon’ take that!?” 

-	The thing is, it’s hard to call the mouse a cobra here, at least in my opinion now that the platform has been out for two weeks. Disney + to me feels barren and its release calendar, while full of great IP, isn’t really something to fawn over. I’m personally most interested in the upcoming Marvel series (Loki, Winter Soldier), but it’s difficult to justify staying a subscriber and being trickle-fed content when I can just cancel and wait a year to binge the best selections over the course of a weekend or two. The 10MM subscribers on release day doesn’t say anything except that people that frequently stream for entertainment are starved for content. 

-	Disney is a massive corporate stitching of media portfolios with tremendous value, but much like Frankenstein’s monster, it is conceivably stiff and inflexible in its operations due to the nature of its composition. The next time Netflix orchestrates another surprising/unique/buzzworthy release, all eyes will be on Disney + to meet or exceed (as is expected in a competitive market), but my expectation is that they will be unable to respond in kind for several years. All of the buzz surrounding Disney + now seems more and more like strictly paid advertising - disingenuous. Seriously, how quickly will the buzz for The Mandalorian *as a driver of the platform* diminish when on the same day as the release of its penultimate episode, Netflix drops a full season of the Witcher series. 

**The streaming wars will not be won solely by the quality of upcoming content, but by the frequency, consistency, and novelty of its release.** Right now it seems like Disney’s best bet is to become the staple family-oriented streaming platform, whereas Netflix is actually competing for most essential viewing platform, period.

Now, for the shit that matters: I started building a $1,000 position in Netflix on Wednesday, buying 310/315 calls expiring 11/29 - 12/06, and 325/340 calls expiring 12/27. Took some profit on Thursday, but still holding 315C - 11/29, and 340C - 12/27. Will likely continue to load up on Monday morning and I intend to hold through to at least Wednesday/Thursday, depending on how things move along. 

Feel free to discuss, I’ll post screenshots of my position if requested.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;List of Original Programs (volume comparison, just click and scroll):
&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Disney%2B#Upcoming_original_programming""&gt;Disney +&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix""&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My central thesis is that the release of Disney + will only serve to retroactively contextualize and reinforce Netflix&amp;#39;s strategy of vast, ongoing investment in their original programming and act as the perfect foil against which Netflix can finally be compared to reveal just how ahead of the competition it truly is. I may say some disparaging things about Disney, but that in no way reflects my opinion on the direction of their stock - I am only commenting on Netflix here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I tend to get long-winded in my writing, but I&amp;#39;m not trying to submit an essay for you degenerates so here are some draft bullets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix has done so much cool shit with their releases in the past, but it’s always gone under the radar or not been fully appreciated. Does anyone remember when they showed the trailer for Cloverfield: Paradox at the Superbowl, and it was available to watch right after? I remember thinking how much of a flex that was to the entire industry, realizing that no other company was positioned or even capable of doing something similar. Whether its movies, television, premium subscriptions, or streaming content - the current model is entrenched in the process by which it is monetized, which is to say that it is deliberately slow and hinges on the hype and anticipation of a release to ensure a return (sponsorships, advertising, product placement, IP, merchandising, etc). Game of Thrones comes to mind here for several reasons, not the least of which is that I started this bullet by mentioning Cloverfield, and both were series with promising beginnings that ended in pointless dogshit. However, in the case of Cloverfield: Paradox, Netflix was able to give it that type of a release and look good regardless of the movie’s reception. That’s a supreme flex, but if you’re already the biggest dude in the gym, you’re just alone straining your biceps in front of a mirror. Netflix Miyagi needed its own Cobra Kai so that next time it beats up a bunch of teenagers in an alley after a Halloween party, the viewing public knows who to look to and say, “Ooooooh shit, you gon’ take that!?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, it’s hard to call the mouse a cobra here, at least in my opinion now that the platform has been out for two weeks. Disney + to me feels barren and its release calendar, while full of great IP, isn’t really something to fawn over. I’m personally most interested in the upcoming Marvel series (Loki, Winter Soldier), but it’s difficult to justify staying a subscriber and being trickle-fed content when I can just cancel and wait a year to binge the best selections over the course of a weekend or two. The 10MM subscribers on release day doesn’t say anything except that people that frequently stream for entertainment are starved for content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is a massive corporate stitching of media portfolios with tremendous value, but much like Frankenstein’s monster, it is conceivably stiff and inflexible in its operations due to the nature of its composition. The next time Netflix orchestrates another surprising/unique/buzzworthy release, all eyes will be on Disney + to meet or exceed (as is expected in a competitive market), but my expectation is that they will be unable to respond in kind for several years. All of the buzz surrounding Disney + now seems more and more like strictly paid advertising - disingenuous. Seriously, how quickly will the buzz for The Mandalorian &lt;em&gt;as a driver of the platform&lt;/em&gt; diminish when on the same day as the release of its penultimate episode, Netflix drops a full season of the Witcher series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The streaming wars will not be won solely by the quality of upcoming content, but by the frequency, consistency, and novelty of its release.&lt;/strong&gt; Right now it seems like Disney’s best bet is to become the staple family-oriented streaming platform, whereas Netflix is actually competing for most essential viewing platform, period.&lt;/p&gt;

My hunch is that HP will announce the acquisition of it's company on their ER on the 26th. I was thinking we might see a response this weekend, so there is still time, but I think they will go forward with it on ER day. 

In my opinion, this is an only win situation unless by for some absolutely ridiculous reason HP sticks to their guns and denies the bid. But I think there are two scenarios that will most likely occur. HP will miss on ER and announce the Xerox buyout, pretty much saving any shorts. OR HP beats ER and the stock pushes to 22-23 but there is still the issue of addressing the Xerox bid, they can't escape it, and according to Xerox, HP shareholders will benefit from the buyout, pushing the stock maybe even to 24-25 if they beat and they agree to the acquisition. 

Either way, I don't think HP will holdout, I think this thing gets announced this week and I think it's a definite win for call buyers. I've also been seeing much more OI and Volume leading up to this week in HP calls. So do with this opinion what you will, but I'm buying in now while shits cheap.

They fucking hunt, do you think a mother fucker dressed in Carhartt would drive this

They do shit like mudding and driving on dirt roads, Elon stop it

They need to haul tools and shit for work, nobody and I mean nobody is pulling up on a job site with this fucking thing.

They pull campers and trailers, you think the lame ass dude pulling a camper arrives at  Yogi Bear Park with the family in the Cyber punk truck

They have a small dick, these fucks want something more flashy, women need to know they have money, a 40k garbage can on wheels won't cut it.

 I showed this truck to my test group of Beckys they thought it was movie prop. I told one of them, imagine we are on a date and the truck breaks down on the way home,  lucky for us I got an ATV charging in the back and I can give you a ride home still. She left me on ""unread""

Overall this truck fucks.

The only use I can think of for this truck is for local shoot outs, the homies can use the flat bed top as a shield. Sadly the windows don't catch bullets right now so put the new guys in the front.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/markets-may-get-a-boost-from-cheery-black-friday-consumer-sentiment-seasonal-strength.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s Thanksgiving time, and investors’ thoughts turn to holiday shopping and a year end Santa rally in the stock market.
*****
&gt; Some analysts think both could be pretty good this year.
*****
&gt; While Black Friday has probably lost some of its claim as the launch of holiday shopping, the Friday after Thanksgiving could provide an early glimpse of how much the consumer will spend this year. The National Retail Federation estimates sales should grow by about 4% in the holiday shopping season, enough to keep the economy rolling along.
*****
&gt; JP Morgan analysts, in a note Friday, said they expect sales to be up 4.9% during the holidays, much stronger than last year, when sales gained just 1.9% and shoppers were discouraged by a major sell off in the stock market.
*****
&gt; As for the stock market, it continues to reach for new highs, and some analysts say that shouldn’t change as the calendar progresses deeper into a seasonally strong time of year for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I actually like adding to equities through the rest of the year,” said Cayman Wills, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
*****
&gt; Wills said she is looking for a better economy, with now no concern about a recession next year. As a result, she began adding to industrials in September and now expects manufacturing data to turn around, supporting her view. She said, if ISM manufacturing data improves Dec. 2, as she expects, industrial company stocks should go even higher.
*****
&gt; The coming week is often a slow one, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and stock exchanges closing down early on Friday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Monday night on the economy, and there are some economic reports worth watching, including durable goods and personal income and spending Wednesday.
*****
&gt; A few final earnings reports are also expected, including Best Buy, HP, and Dell.
*****
&gt; In the bond market, the Treasury auctions $113 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching impeachment proceedings in the House, but analysts do not expect the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump to affect markets, since there is little chance he would be convicted by the Republican majority in the Senate.
*****
&gt; Developments on trade talks between the U.S. and China, are by far the most important event for markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s a call on trade in our view. You can’t really predict what Xi and Trump will do,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates, at Wells Fargo. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.75% Friday, from a high of 1.95% on Nov. 12. Rates have moved lower as concerns have increased that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal by Dec. 15, heading off a new round of tariffs expected to take effect that day.
*****
&gt; But stocks have not reacted as much to disappointing trade headlines, and are instead looking forward to a new round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The S&amp;P 500 was roughly half percent away from its all time high Friday.
*****
&gt; “Trade is the nugget that helped lead the market higher,” Wills said. “In August we were trading at 16 times [earnings], now we’re at 17.8 times. If the market took out the benefit we saw from trade, it would probably be about 8% lower. That’s not our base case.”
*****
&gt; She expects to see some form of a phase one trade deal, and investors will continue to monitor every headline and tweet about trade talks. U.S. trade negotiators were invited to China to take part in a new round of face-to-face talks, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Friday, Trump said a deal was close.
*****
&gt; “I think there will be continued positive momentum,” said Wills, adding that incumbent presidents know a good economy is important in an election year.
*****
&gt; # Stocks could ‘turkey trot’ higher
&gt; The week around Thanksgiving is often positive for stocks. “If we were using history as a guide, that means we could see the final leg of this turkey trot in the week of Thanksgiving where we end [higher], then spend the next week or so digesting the recent gain,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there likely will be a Santa rally this year, but the market typically dips in the middle of December before moving higher. “December is the best month [for the S&amp;P 500]. On average, it’s up 1.6% and also has risen 76% of the time since World War II. It’s the highest price change and the best frequency for an up move of any month,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler of T3Live. com said it’s very likely there will be a Santa rally taking the market higher into the end of December. “A lot of analysts have a target of 3,200 for this year, but we were a little ahead of ourselves. A week of digestion is welcome. Traders are looking to make sure the market holds 3,070 to 3,090 to give more confidence that the Santa rally could bring it to 3,200 by year end. The question is can the market hold these levels,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; The 3,090 level is the low from this past week, and the 21-day moving average, a momentum indicator, is at 3,075.
*****
&gt; “This week stocks took a little bit of a breather. Next week has a better chance of being seasonally strong,” he said. “This week was more of a breather than a break that could have happened on trade talks.”
*****
&gt; Retail will dominate in the week ahead, as markets watch the final group of store chains report earnings. Dollar Tree, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy report on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Target in the past week gave positive indications for the holiday shopping season, as did Walmart the week before. But Home Depot lowered its sales forecast when it reported earnings, and Macy’s slashed its outlook..
*****
&gt; “There are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas but CFRA does not see this weighing on sales,” said Stovall. “Our analysts expect the tight time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be a boon for retailers which have “buy-online-pickup-in-stores” capabilities.”
*****
&gt; Retail sales are important since the consumer drives more than two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; “The peak of the season includes 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 33 days last year, which is the shortest since 2013. Notably, with Cyber Week and online penetration growing, this is less a risk than the days of yore while the shorter season will likely lessen the depth of the slowdown in early December,” the JP Morgan retail analysts wrote.

# Big Year-to-Date Gains Through November Bode Well for December and 2020

&gt; Going back to 1949 we are on pace for the 10th biggest year-to-date through November gains for the S&amp;P 500 – and it’s a healthy sign for the rest of the year and next. We crunched the numbers for the S&amp;P 500 YTD gains as of the end of November. Average YTD November gains are 7.4%. The list below shows the Top 21 YTD November that are all twice the average, which we felt best represents the current situation.

&gt; Following Decembers and following years have had solid performance and average to slightly better than average results. After big YTD gains December is up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 1.7% and the next year is up 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 9.9%. The reinforces our positive outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020.

# Average Performance Nearly Doubles in Pre-Election Year Decembers

&gt; December is now the number two S&amp;P 500 month and the third best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). Last year DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of last year is not that likely. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half.

&gt; In pre-election years, December’s overall ranking remains about the same across the board however, average gains improve handsomely. DJIA averages 2.7%, S&amp;P 500 2.9%, NASDAQ 4.3%, Russell 1000 2.9% and Russell 2000 3.1%. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 pre-election year Decembers. DJIA’s worst pre-election December was in 2015 when it declined a modest 1.7%. DJIA’s best pre-election year December was in 1991, up 9.5%.

&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.

# Russell 2000 Q4 Best 20 Days

&gt; We have been tracking seasonal market behavior for over five decades and have highlighted fourth quarter strength, holiday trading patterns and monthly trading patterns among other seasonal trading strategies for years.

&gt; There has been a little twitter chatter of late about the old Russell 2000 4th Quarter Best 20 Days Strategy. Lore has is that the Best 20 Days of the 4th quarter for the Russell 2000 are the last two trading days of October, the first two of November, the last seven of November and the last nine of December.

&gt; For perspective I have compare the Russell 2000 to the S&amp;P 500 over these 20 “Best” Days. Russell 2000 does beat the S&amp;P 500 with a cumulative median gain over these 20 days since 1979 of 4.6% and an impressive record of up 38 of the last 40 years, while the S&amp;P 500 delivered a respectable median gain of 3.1%, up 37 of the last 40 years.

# Don’t Fear Record Highs

&gt; “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” – Warren Buffett

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has trended higher in an unusually persistent fashion recently. The benchmark has notched 10 record-high closes over the past four weeks, including four straight through November 18.

&gt; It’s human nature to get nervous when market conditions are too calm, especially with an uncertain outlook and an aging bull market. However, we urge investors not to lose sight of their goals.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has consistently powered past record highs. Since 1950, the benchmark.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-return-after-high_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks rarely move higher in a straight line, though. Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 2% in the month after a record-high close. In 2018, the S&amp;P 500 notched a record high September 20, only to fall nearly 20% by December 24. Volatility can be uncomfortable, and it can be difficult to stay focused on long-term prospects when prices are falling.

&gt; Luckily, history shows that even the swiftest sell-offs don’t last forever. After the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 20% slide in late 2018, it recouped all of its losses in the next four months. In 2011, the index dropped 19% from April to October before reaching new highs again in March 2012. The S&amp;P 500 even found its way back to record highs after the 2008–09 financial crisis, nearly 5.5 years after its 2007 October peak.

&gt; “Even though the path can be rocky, stocks have historically offered long-term opportunity for investors,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It’s important to stick to your investing plan in times of volatility and calm. We still view volatility as an opportunity for suitable long-term investors consider rebalancing portfolios or add to positions.”

# STrump vs. the Average Presidential Election Cycle

&gt; With year three of the current four-year Presidential Election Cycle coming to an end in six weeks, below is an updated look at the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year of the cycle going back to 1928. As shown, years one and two have historically been weaker than years three and four of the cycle. The S&amp;P has been up 56.5% of the time in both year one and year two, but the index has been up 81.8% of the time in year three and 72.7% of the time in year four. Year three has been by far the best year of the cycle with an average gain of 12.81%, and the playbook has stuck to the script in year three of the current cycle with the S&amp;P up 24.5% year-to-date. While year four has historically been consistently positive with gains 72.7% of the time, the average change for the S&amp;P in year four (+5.71%) is just barely better than the average change in years one and two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/trump-vs-cycle-table.png))**

&gt; Below we show the S&amp;P 500 under Trump so far versus a composite of the S&amp;P four-year Presidential cycle. The S&amp;P gained 19.4% in year one of the current cycle versus an average year-one gain of 5.7%. Year two is historically the worst year of the cycle with an average gain of just 4.54%, and in Trump's second year, the S&amp;P actually fell 6.2%. So far this year, the S&amp;P is up 24.5% versus the average gain of 12.8% during year three of the cycle. As shown in the chart, year four generally trends positively but experiences pullbacks shortly after Q1 and again in October leading up the Election Day before closing out the year strong.

# Which of These Sectors is Not Like the Other

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is right at all-time highs, but if you look at your portfolio or a random list of stocks, with some of the winners there are bound to be some clunkers. Before getting too restless, though, it's important to keep in mind that not all stocks rally or decline in unison with each other. The chart below perfectly illustrates this. In it, we show the average distance that stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading with respect to their 52-week highs. For the S&amp;P 1500 as a whole, stocks in the index are collectively trading an average of 16.2% from their respective 52-week highs. Large-cap stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are the closest to 52-week highs at just a hair above 10%. Mid Caps are down an average of 14.8% while small caps have been the big laggard with stocks in the S&amp;P 600 down an average of 22.2% from their 52-week highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs.png))**

&gt; Small-cap stocks have been a laggard for the last year, and one of the key drivers of that weakness has been the Energy sector. The chart below shows how far stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading relative to their 52-week highs broken out by sector. It's not often that you see one sector as such a big outlier relative to all the others, but the Energy sector is in a league of its own these days. Stocks in the sector are more depressed than any other, trading down an average of 42.8% from their 52-week highs. Behind Energy, the next closest sector is Communication Services at an average of 22.7%. That's a spread of more than 20 percentage points between the two sectors with stocks furthest below their 52-week highs!

&gt; While stocks in the Energy and Communication Services sectors are the furthest below their 52-week highs, sectors that are the closest include Utilities and Financials where the average stock in each sector is down less than 10% from their 52-week highs.

# What Does the Market Know About the Consumer That We Don't?

&gt; In just about any economic discussion you read or listen to these days, there's one recurring theme- the strong consumer is picking up the slack. Strong consumer sentiment and generational lows in the unemployment rate are just two of many examples. A search of the term ""strong consumer"" on Google Trends also illustrates the strength of the consumer. While there's still another nine days left in the month, searches for the term ""strong consumer"" in November are on pace to be the highest in at least a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112119-Strong-Consumer.png))**

&gt; So, we all agree that the consumer is strong. Right? Well, recently the market begs to differ. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector versus the S&amp;P 500 over the last year. When the line is rising, it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is outperforming the S&amp;P 500. However, when the line is falling it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is underperforming, and underperforming is what the sector is doing now...in a big way. Even as the S&amp;P 500 is up around 4% in the last month, the Consumer Discretionary sector is down 1%. While many traditional brick and mortar retailers that have fallen on hard times are in the sector because these stocks are already down so much, their weighting in the index has become very small. Meanwhile, stocks that have previously been big winners like Amazon.com (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), and McDonald's (MCD) are the sector's largest components. Does the market know something we don't?

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Saturday morning to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/wallstreetbets""&gt;r/wallstreetbets&lt;/a&gt;. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 25th, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/markets-may-get-a-boost-from-cheery-black-friday-consumer-sentiment-seasonal-strength.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Thanksgiving time, and investors’ thoughts turn to holiday shopping and a year end Santa rally in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some analysts think both could be pretty good this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Black Friday has probably lost some of its claim as the launch of holiday shopping, the Friday after Thanksgiving could provide an early glimpse of how much the consumer will spend this year. The National Retail Federation estimates sales should grow by about 4% in the holiday shopping season, enough to keep the economy rolling along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan analysts, in a note Friday, said they expect sales to be up 4.9% during the holidays, much stronger than last year, when sales gained just 1.9% and shoppers were discouraged by a major sell off in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the stock market, it continues to reach for new highs, and some analysts say that shouldn’t change as the calendar progresses deeper into a seasonally strong time of year for stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I actually like adding to equities through the rest of the year,” said Cayman Wills, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wills said she is looking for a better economy, with now no concern about a recession next year. As a result, she began adding to industrials in September and now expects manufacturing data to turn around, supporting her view. She said, if ISM manufacturing data improves Dec. 2, as she expects, industrial company stocks should go even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coming week is often a slow one, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and stock exchanges closing down early on Friday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Monday night on the economy, and there are some economic reports worth watching, including durable goods and personal income and spending Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few final earnings reports are also expected, including Best Buy, HP, and Dell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the bond market, the Treasury auctions $113 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are also watching impeachment proceedings in the House, but analysts do not expect the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump to affect markets, since there is little chance he would be convicted by the Republican majority in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developments on trade talks between the U.S. and China, are by far the most important event for markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a call on trade in our view. You can’t really predict what Xi and Trump will do,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates, at Wells Fargo. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.75% Friday, from a high of 1.95% on Nov. 12. Rates have moved lower as concerns have increased that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal by Dec. 15, heading off a new round of tariffs expected to take effect that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But stocks have not reacted as much to disappointing trade headlines, and are instead looking forward to a new round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The S&amp;amp;P 500 was roughly half percent away from its all time high Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trade is the nugget that helped lead the market higher,” Wills said. “In August we were trading at 16 times [earnings], now we’re at 17.8 times. If the market took out the benefit we saw from trade, it would probably be about 8% lower. That’s not our base case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She expects to see some form of a phase one trade deal, and investors will continue to monitor every headline and tweet about trade talks. U.S. trade negotiators were invited to China to take part in a new round of face-to-face talks, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Friday, Trump said a deal was close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think there will be continued positive momentum,” said Wills, adding that incumbent presidents know a good economy is important in an election year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stocks could ‘turkey trot’ higher&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week around Thanksgiving is often positive for stocks. “If we were using history as a guide, that means we could see the final leg of this turkey trot in the week of Thanksgiving where we end [higher], then spend the next week or so digesting the recent gain,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stovall said there likely will be a Santa rally this year, but the market typically dips in the middle of December before moving higher. “December is the best month [for the S&amp;amp;P 500]. On average, it’s up 1.6% and also has risen 76% of the time since World War II. It’s the highest price change and the best frequency for an up move of any month,” said Stovall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Redler of T3Live. com said it’s very likely there will be a Santa rally taking the market higher into the end of December. “A lot of analysts have a target of 3,200 for this year, but we were a little ahead of ourselves. A week of digestion is welcome. Traders are looking to make sure the market holds 3,070 to 3,090 to give more confidence that the Santa rally could bring it to 3,200 by year end. The question is can the market hold these levels,” Redler said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3,090 level is the low from this past week, and the 21-day moving average, a momentum indicator, is at 3,075.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This week stocks took a little bit of a breather. Next week has a better chance of being seasonally strong,” he said. “This week was more of a breather than a break that could have happened on trade talks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail will dominate in the week ahead, as markets watch the final group of store chains report earnings. Dollar Tree, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy report on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Target in the past week gave positive indications for the holiday shopping season, as did Walmart the week before. But Home Depot lowered its sales forecast when it reported earnings, and Macy’s slashed its outlook..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas but CFRA does not see this weighing on sales,” said Stovall. “Our analysts expect the tight time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be a boon for retailers which have “buy-online-pickup-in-stores” capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail sales are important since the consumer drives more than two-thirds of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The peak of the season includes 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 33 days last year, which is the shortest since 2013. Notably, with Cyber Week and online penetration growing, this is less a risk than the days of yore while the shorter season will likely lessen the depth of the slowdown in early December,” the JP Morgan retail analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Big Year-to-Date Gains Through November Bode Well for December and 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to 1949 we are on pace for the 10th biggest year-to-date through November gains for the S&amp;amp;P 500 – and it’s a healthy sign for the rest of the year and next. We crunched the numbers for the S&amp;amp;P 500 YTD gains as of the end of November. Average YTD November gains are 7.4%. The list below shows the Top 21 YTD November that are all twice the average, which we felt best represents the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Decembers and following years have had solid performance and average to slightly better than average results. After big YTD gains December is up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 1.7% and the next year is up 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 9.9%. The reinforces our positive outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3f59aa1b657802b503ab32ce0db9bbd/ed8d0afaa9464f0b-49/s500x750/f6168a118ffdc907a5e494d03ba771a76a7294c8.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Average Performance Nearly Doubles in Pre-Election Year Decembers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December is now the number two S&amp;amp;P 500 month and the third best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). Last year DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of last year is not that likely. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pre-election years, December’s overall ranking remains about the same across the board however, average gains improve handsomely. DJIA averages 2.7%, S&amp;amp;P 500 2.9%, NASDAQ 4.3%, Russell 1000 2.9% and Russell 2000 3.1%. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 pre-election year Decembers. DJIA’s worst pre-election December was in 2015 when it declined a modest 1.7%. DJIA’s best pre-election year December was in 1991, up 9.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://66.media.tumblr.com/95f58c7a8f6d6028d34c887e4823f539/28be27dff6a591d2-9f/s400x600/85d80dffe50b9ba98966dd719c3143a7672fcb43.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Russell 2000 Q4 Best 20 Days&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been tracking seasonal market behavior for over five decades and have highlighted fourth quarter strength, holiday trading patterns and monthly trading patterns among other seasonal trading strategies for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a little twitter chatter of late about the old Russell 2000 4th Quarter Best 20 Days Strategy. Lore has is that the Best 20 Days of the 4th quarter for the Russell 2000 are the last two trading days of October, the first two of November, the last seven of November and the last nine of December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For perspective I have compare the Russell 2000 to the S&amp;amp;P 500 over these 20 “Best” Days. Russell 2000 does beat the S&amp;amp;P 500 with a cumulative median gain over these 20 days since 1979 of 4.6% and an impressive record of up 38 of the last 40 years, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 delivered a respectable median gain of 3.1%, up 37 of the last 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://66.media.tumblr.com/561d546d830cce4205905f73ea7755d8/b29aa69cdb4ef152-26/s640x960/e1fde82ceb38f0323dd5dd80c7d8f2cedd295f9a.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Don’t Fear Record Highs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” – Warren Buffett&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 Index has trended higher in an unusually persistent fashion recently. The benchmark has notched 10 record-high closes over the past four weeks, including four straight through November 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s human nature to get nervous when market conditions are too calm, especially with an uncertain outlook and an aging bull market. However, we urge investors not to lose sight of their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has consistently powered past record highs. Since 1950, the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-return-after-high_1.png?ssl=1""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks rarely move higher in a straight line, though. Since 1950, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has declined an average of 2% in the month after a record-high close. In 2018, the S&amp;amp;P 500 notched a record high September 20, only to fall nearly 20% by December 24. Volatility can be uncomfortable, and it can be difficult to stay focused on long-term prospects when prices are falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, history shows that even the swiftest sell-offs don’t last forever. After the S&amp;amp;P 500’s nearly 20% slide in late 2018, it recouped all of its losses in the next four months. In 2011, the index dropped 19% from April to October before reaching new highs again in March 2012. The S&amp;amp;P 500 even found its way back to record highs after the 2008–09 financial crisis, nearly 5.5 years after its 2007 October peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even though the path can be rocky, stocks have historically offered long-term opportunity for investors,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It’s important to stick to your investing plan in times of volatility and calm. We still view volatility as an opportunity for suitable long-term investors consider rebalancing portfolios or add to positions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;STrump vs. the Average Presidential Election Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With year three of the current four-year Presidential Election Cycle coming to an end in six weeks, below is an updated look at the average performance of the S&amp;amp;P 500 in each year of the cycle going back to 1928. As shown, years one and two have historically been weaker than years three and four of the cycle. The S&amp;amp;P has been up 56.5% of the time in both year one and year two, but the index has been up 81.8% of the time in year three and 72.7% of the time in year four. Year three has been by far the best year of the cycle with an average gain of 12.81%, and the playbook has stuck to the script in year three of the current cycle with the S&amp;amp;P up 24.5% year-to-date. While year four has historically been consistently positive with gains 72.7% of the time, the average change for the S&amp;amp;P in year four (+5.71%) is just barely better than the average change in years one and two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below we show the S&amp;amp;P 500 under Trump so far versus a composite of the S&amp;amp;P four-year Presidential cycle. The S&amp;amp;P gained 19.4% in year one of the current cycle versus an average year-one gain of 5.7%. Year two is historically the worst year of the cycle with an average gain of just 4.54%, and in Trump&amp;#39;s second year, the S&amp;amp;P actually fell 6.2%. So far this year, the S&amp;amp;P is up 24.5% versus the average gain of 12.8% during year three of the cycle. As shown in the chart, year four generally trends positively but experiences pullbacks shortly after Q1 and again in October leading up the Election Day before closing out the year strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Which of These Sectors is Not Like the Other&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is right at all-time highs, but if you look at your portfolio or a random list of stocks, with some of the winners there are bound to be some clunkers. Before getting too restless, though, it&amp;#39;s important to keep in mind that not all stocks rally or decline in unison with each other. The chart below perfectly illustrates this. In it, we show the average distance that stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 1500 are trading with respect to their 52-week highs. For the S&amp;amp;P 1500 as a whole, stocks in the index are collectively trading an average of 16.2% from their respective 52-week highs. Large-cap stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 are the closest to 52-week highs at just a hair above 10%. Mid Caps are down an average of 14.8% while small caps have been the big laggard with stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 600 down an average of 22.2% from their 52-week highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small-cap stocks have been a laggard for the last year, and one of the key drivers of that weakness has been the Energy sector. The chart below shows how far stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 1500 are trading relative to their 52-week highs broken out by sector. It&amp;#39;s not often that you see one sector as such a big outlier relative to all the others, but the Energy sector is in a league of its own these days. Stocks in the sector are more depressed than any other, trading down an average of 42.8% from their 52-week highs. Behind Energy, the next closest sector is Communication Services at an average of 22.7%. That&amp;#39;s a spread of more than 20 percentage points between the two sectors with stocks furthest below their 52-week highs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While stocks in the Energy and Communication Services sectors are the furthest below their 52-week highs, sectors that are the closest include Utilities and Financials where the average stock in each sector is down less than 10% from their 52-week highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs-Sectors.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What Does the Market Know About the Consumer That We Don&amp;#39;t?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just about any economic discussion you read or listen to these days, there&amp;#39;s one recurring theme- the strong consumer is picking up the slack. Strong consumer sentiment and generational lows in the unemployment rate are just two of many examples. A search of the term &amp;quot;strong consumer&amp;quot; on Google Trends also illustrates the strength of the consumer. While there&amp;#39;s still another nine days left in the month, searches for the term &amp;quot;strong consumer&amp;quot; in November are on pace to be the highest in at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we all agree that the consumer is strong. Right? Well, recently the market begs to differ. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector versus the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the last year. When the line is rising, it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is outperforming the S&amp;amp;P 500. However, when the line is falling it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is underperforming, and underperforming is what the sector is doing now...in a big way. Even as the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up around 4% in the last month, the Consumer Discretionary sector is down 1%. While many traditional brick and mortar retailers that have fallen on hard times are in the sector because these stocks are already down so much, their weighting in the index has become very small. Meanwhile, stocks that have previously been big winners like Amazon.com (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), and McDonald&amp;#39;s (MCD) are the sector&amp;#39;s largest components. Does the market know something we don&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;

Looks like it’s time for another episode of “u/thiccdadsclub explains shit to retards”!

When you place an order with a broker, whether to buy or sell a security (be that options, futures, shares of a triple-leveraged ETF that tracks Chinese REITs, or even a “stock”, whatever that is) you imagine that your order gets sent from your broker to the exchange, right? You think your order to buy one share of the latest weed stock is sitting up there on a server in NASDAQ’s data center waiting to be matched to a seller. Wrong, idiot. God you’re so fucking 
*stupid*.

Your broker has agreements in place with companies called “market makers” or “liquidity providers” or “dark pools” or other terms. I’ll call them liquidity providers. Your order goes to them, and they decide whether to pass it on to the exchange or whether to fill it from their own personal vault of cash and securities.

For example, suppose a stock is trading with a bid of $100 and an ask of $101. You, an idiot, submit a market order to your broker to buy one share and I, a genius, submit a market order to my broker to sell one share. By chance, our brokers both send the orders to the same liquidity provider, who decides to close the trades internally rather than send them to the exchange. They buy my share at the bid of $100 and then sell that share to you at the ask of $101, pocketing $1 in the process.

Now the liquidity provider can’t just pick any damn price to fill the orders at. By law they have to stick to the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), which are the bid and ask prices that the average customer would see on the real exchange(s) that trade that particular security.

The liquidity provider is allowed to do *better* than the NBBO though. For example, suppose on the exchange that same stock is trading with an ask of $100 and a bid of $101 and again, you submit a market buy order and I submit a market sell order. The liquidity provider could buy my share for $100.25 and sell it to you for $100.75. They only make $0.50 instead of $1.00 but now they can claim that they offer tighter spreads than available on the exchange and retail customers like us wet our panties with excitement at all the money we’ll make. This is called “price improvement”.

If the orders are *limit* orders instead of market orders, then the liquidity provider has to check how the limit compares to NBBO to see what price they would have to fill it at and whether price improvement is possible. For example, if your buy order had a limit of no more than $100.60 and my sell order had a limit of no less than $100.40 then the liquidity provider has to decide whether to fill internally at those prices, providing huge price improvement and only a $0.20 profit, or pass it on to the exchange.

Now note two important things. First, if there’s no volume for the security then there’s no NBBO and the liquidity provider isn’t going to fill it internally. This doesn’t really happen with stocks but with options you can pick stupid strike prices where there’s nobody buying or selling. The liquidity provider should send those orders to the exchange where they will wait until somebody wants them or they are canceled.

Second, the liquidity provider should never provide such huge price improvement that the customer sees a negative spread. Suppose you submit your limit buy order with a limit of $95 this time, far less than the national best bid. The liquidity provider would be stupid to fill that internally; it’s basically a guaranteed loss for them and a guaranteed profit for you.

A long iron condor is a set of four options contracts that are ordered at once. It doesn’t really matter what they are or why somebody would want one, just know that when you open a long iron condor you are placing four orders: 2 limit buys and 2 limit sells. All four orders have to fill or none are filled. When you open a long iron condor you immediately receive a credit. If all four options eventually expire worthless you keep the full credit; otherwise you lose some or all of it depending on what happens. You want the underlying security to be stable in price and the options to expire worthless.

It’s really easy to create an order for a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless; just pick ridiculous strike prices for the four “legs” of the order. But of course there won’t be any volume for an iron condor like that, because who would be taking the other side of that trade? To make it doubly worthless you could set your limits such that it would create a negative spread. The order should never fill; no human being would ever take the other side of that trade, paying way too much for worthless contracts.

But who needs a human being when you have a liquidity provider with buggy software and a broker with an appetite for risk!

Two users (the aforementioned u/aidangamer28 and u/bearhobag) have found that using Robinhood under certain conditions you can open a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless and has a ridiculous limit price and it *will* be filled... by Robinhood’s liquidity provider! And worse still, Robinhood will let you use that net credit to boost your leverage immediately, so you don’t even have to wait for the options to expire before spending the money (on more iron condors, obv.)

Essentially it seems that Robinhood’s liquidity provider (Citadel Trading or Virtu Financial) has a bug that causes them to internally fill orders for long iron condors with (1) low volume and (2) stupid limits. These orders should have gone to the exchange where nobody would take them, but instead they are being filled at whatever limit price the user asks for, even if that means an effective negative spread. I suggest we call this the “infinite price improvement” cheat code.

Hope that helps, don’t @ me you losers

Edit: It’s very unclear at this point what combinations of underlying securities, strike prices, and limits will exploit this bug. Both posters provided proof that satisfied the mods, but it only takes a hearty dick to satisfy the mods so.. 

It’s also unclear whether this is illegal or not. On the surface it seems that if Citadel wants to buy your shitty iron condors at your shitty prices then hey, that’s their business, keep selling them until they’re bankrupt. On the other hand, prison would suck.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends from &lt;a href=""/r/all""&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; are quite confused about this latest Robinhood fuckup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like it’s time for another episode of “u/thiccdadsclub explains shit to retards”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you place an order with a broker, whether to buy or sell a security (be that options, futures, shares of a triple-leveraged ETF that tracks Chinese REITs, or even a “stock”, whatever that is) you imagine that your order gets sent from your broker to the exchange, right? You think your order to buy one share of the latest weed stock is sitting up there on a server in NASDAQ’s data center waiting to be matched to a seller. Wrong, idiot. God you’re so fucking 
&lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your broker has agreements in place with companies called “market makers” or “liquidity providers” or “dark pools” or other terms. I’ll call them liquidity providers. Your order goes to them, and they decide whether to pass it on to the exchange or whether to fill it from their own personal vault of cash and securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose a stock is trading with a bid of $100 and an ask of $101. You, an idiot, submit a market order to your broker to buy one share and I, a genius, submit a market order to my broker to sell one share. By chance, our brokers both send the orders to the same liquidity provider, who decides to close the trades internally rather than send them to the exchange. They buy my share at the bid of $100 and then sell that share to you at the ask of $101, pocketing $1 in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the liquidity provider can’t just pick any damn price to fill the orders at. By law they have to stick to the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), which are the bid and ask prices that the average customer would see on the real exchange(s) that trade that particular security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liquidity provider is allowed to do &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than the NBBO though. For example, suppose on the exchange that same stock is trading with an ask of $100 and a bid of $101 and again, you submit a market buy order and I submit a market sell order. The liquidity provider could buy my share for $100.25 and sell it to you for $100.75. They only make $0.50 instead of $1.00 but now they can claim that they offer tighter spreads than available on the exchange and retail customers like us wet our panties with excitement at all the money we’ll make. This is called “price improvement”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the orders are &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; orders instead of market orders, then the liquidity provider has to check how the limit compares to NBBO to see what price they would have to fill it at and whether price improvement is possible. For example, if your buy order had a limit of no more than $100.60 and my sell order had a limit of no less than $100.40 then the liquidity provider has to decide whether to fill internally at those prices, providing huge price improvement and only a $0.20 profit, or pass it on to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now note two important things. First, if there’s no volume for the security then there’s no NBBO and the liquidity provider isn’t going to fill it internally. This doesn’t really happen with stocks but with options you can pick stupid strike prices where there’s nobody buying or selling. The liquidity provider should send those orders to the exchange where they will wait until somebody wants them or they are canceled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the liquidity provider should never provide such huge price improvement that the customer sees a negative spread. Suppose you submit your limit buy order with a limit of $95 this time, far less than the national best bid. The liquidity provider would be stupid to fill that internally; it’s basically a guaranteed loss for them and a guaranteed profit for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long iron condor is a set of four options contracts that are ordered at once. It doesn’t really matter what they are or why somebody would want one, just know that when you open a long iron condor you are placing four orders: 2 limit buys and 2 limit sells. All four orders have to fill or none are filled. When you open a long iron condor you immediately receive a credit. If all four options eventually expire worthless you keep the full credit; otherwise you lose some or all of it depending on what happens. You want the underlying security to be stable in price and the options to expire worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really easy to create an order for a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless; just pick ridiculous strike prices for the four “legs” of the order. But of course there won’t be any volume for an iron condor like that, because who would be taking the other side of that trade? To make it doubly worthless you could set your limits such that it would create a negative spread. The order should never fill; no human being would ever take the other side of that trade, paying way too much for worthless contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But who needs a human being when you have a liquidity provider with buggy software and a broker with an appetite for risk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two users (the aforementioned &lt;a href=""/u/aidangamer28""&gt;u/aidangamer28&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/u/bearhobag""&gt;u/bearhobag&lt;/a&gt;) have found that using Robinhood under certain conditions you can open a long iron condor that is almost guaranteed to expire worthless and has a ridiculous limit price and it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be filled... by Robinhood’s liquidity provider! And worse still, Robinhood will let you use that net credit to boost your leverage immediately, so you don’t even have to wait for the options to expire before spending the money (on more iron condors, obv.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially it seems that Robinhood’s liquidity provider (Citadel Trading or Virtu Financial) has a bug that causes them to internally fill orders for long iron condors with (1) low volume and (2) stupid limits. These orders should have gone to the exchange where nobody would take them, but instead they are being filled at whatever limit price the user asks for, even if that means an effective negative spread. I suggest we call this the “infinite price improvement” cheat code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps, don’t @ me you losers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: It’s very unclear at this point what combinations of underlying securities, strike prices, and limits will exploit this bug. Both posters provided proof that satisfied the mods, but it only takes a hearty dick to satisfy the mods so.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear whether this is illegal or not. On the surface it seems that if Citadel wants to buy your shitty iron condors at your shitty prices then hey, that’s their business, keep selling them until they’re bankrupt. On the other hand, prison would suck.&lt;/p&gt;

for the all new, Robinhood Infinite Money Glitch! What you have to do is find a company that offers high payouts for short term, low risk iron condors. For example you can buy two out of the money calls and two in the money puts and still get offered $30 for every $100 you spend, or an even better amount like I’ve been finding, example $50 for every $100 I spend, (and buy $100 I mean 1 iron condor and for $30 and $50 I mean the min credit you’d be receiving for buying 1 iron condor) and since these calls and puts are always very far away from the actual stock price you have a very low chance of the iron condor actually failing you if the stock goes up or down. 
  
I’ve been doing this to FB, TTWO, GOOGL, and AMZN. For example this iron condor is on TTWO (take two interactive), for the iron condor, I’m selling a 130 call, buying a 131 call, selling a 117 put, and buying a 116 put all expiring 12/6, and the price of TTWO is now $121. (LOOK AT THE PICTURES) The limit price for this trade is .03 but with the crazy bid ask spread price that happens after hours, Robinhood will ask you to put in your own limit price of .95 specifically for this trade, you’ll put that in the limit price section, then you will make $95 instead of $3 with an $100 collateral, and once Friday comes along you will have made $195 off of a $100 trade!
 
 (Next few sentences is pretty much what I just said but these sentences go for any stock and not just TTWO) Then what you do is buy however many iron condors of this trade you want. When you accept everything on the order page of the iron condor, it will ask you credit or debit, choose credit, then it will say this iron condor has a special bid ask spread and it will ask you to choose a limit price. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Right then and there you have to choose the special bid ask spread in the limit price section. In my example it gave me a .95 limit price giving me $95 for every $100 iron condor. Then you place the order and it will get placed when the market opens (or by the end of the market day). 
  
If the order doesn’t get placed because the limit price is too high, try lowering it by .10, if you can’t completely double your money with this iron condor this method will still work as long as you gain 50% of what the colateral cost is, so if you’re lucky and can find a regular iron condor offering 50% of what the colateral cost is, then you don’t even have to mess around with the limit price and that will insure the order gets placed! And yes you need someone to actually sell you the iron condor too and that’s what makes this glitch awesome as it gets filled with this ridiculous limit price. 
  
IF YOU’RE CONFUSED LOOK AT THE PICTURES AT THE END OF THIS POST AND THAT WILL HELP EXPLAIN EVERYTHING! Yes this does seem to be a somewhat weird iron condor trade so far but here’s the thing, you’re doubling the money your investing using margin so margin will also double the total amount of money it can lend to you, this will lead to unlimited gains/money! Then you keep on doing this method until this glitch gets patched and then we can all buy out google, we’ll all run the board and then we can take out assets and throw one huge damn party!!!!! 
  
See you all on Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Market Watch, Buisness Insider and Fox! By the way I can’t figure out a way to show my margin doubling so the picture is of GUH instead!

[See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4od5z/the_infinite_money_bug_uaidangamer28_discovered/f9f3rao/).

I wrote myself some scripts to interact with the Robinhood API back in March. While testing them out I found something weird. If you bought options with the bid/ask at 0.00/0.01 and then tried to sell them back with a multi-leg order, Robinhood would buy them back at 0.01 each.

The bid/ask was at 0.00/0.01. You would buy for 0.01. When you tried to sell back, the bid/ask would still be 0.00/0.01, so you should not have been able to sell. Yet the RH API would let you sell for 0.01. You could buy as many shit 0.00/0.01 options you wanted, your RH net worth graph would drop (reflecting your poor choice), and then you could get them all refunded and your RH net worth graph would go back up.

This never failed and I never had any money taken out of my account as a result.

I always thought this was an API-specific bug, and I was too scared to investigate it and risk legal trouble.

My guess is that /u/Aidangamer28's iron condors are erroneously getting filled due to a similar Robinhood order-flow bug. He accidentally found a way to abuse the bug I was too scared to look into.

Edit:
You could buy options for $0.01 and hold them for a couple of days (didn't try more). If they went to $0.00, you could get a full refund. If they went to $0.02 (happened in one of my tests), you would double your money.

When I went digging through the logs to show the mods, I understood what the actual mechanism was. The end result is still the same though, the order of things is just different. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4od5z/the_infinite_money_bug_uaidangamer28_discovered/f9f3rao/""&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote myself some scripts to interact with the Robinhood API back in March. While testing them out I found something weird. If you bought options with the bid/ask at 0.00/0.01 and then tried to sell them back with a multi-leg order, Robinhood would buy them back at 0.01 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bid/ask was at 0.00/0.01. You would buy for 0.01. When you tried to sell back, the bid/ask would still be 0.00/0.01, so you should not have been able to sell. Yet the RH API would let you sell for 0.01. You could buy as many shit 0.00/0.01 options you wanted, your RH net worth graph would drop (reflecting your poor choice), and then you could get them all refunded and your RH net worth graph would go back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This never failed and I never had any money taken out of my account as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

I told her I wouldn't go to the mall but then I thought about all the insider information I'd get from actually being inside stores so I said I'd go. 

First thing we see when we pull up to the Macy's at the mall, bunch of fucking garbage outside in their bushes.  Plastic bags, bottles, other shit, I was like mom what the fuck is Macy's on rn.  They got hella people inside, and not one poor fucker can go out and pull the shit off their bushes?  So we rolled through mad quick because there were just way too many red dresses and I'm a dude so like I'm not trying to be like that.  Short em, they're dying.

We head over to Tommy Hilfiger's.  Now idk if any of you have been unfortunate enough to walk into a TH store, but holy shit I have never seen an uglier collection of clothing.  There were like these sleeveless puffer vests that had these rainbow-plaid patterns all over that I have never seen a single soul wearing.  I actually stayed in Hilfiger's more than other stores because I was just in so much amazement at how ugly their shit was. Short the fuck out of em.

Anyway, tried Ralph Lauren, wasn't a 65 year old golf-bro so I left. They're so fucking boring, Iron Condor is the play.

Eventually I just walked past an American Eagle, saw a decent looking jacket, walked in, it was 60% off, bought it and left. Long AEO, profit margins may be tight tho.

Now I would make these plays before next earnings calls myself, but my RH has 28 cents left down from 1300 bucks so hopefully someone else can capitalize on this dd.

I’m 80% sure on this. But if I’m wrong and you lose money just remember that you listened to a random guy on the internet. On the other hand if you win bigly, remember that it was all thanks to a guy on the internet. Good luck

Now you’ve got two scenarios, the more likely one is that you being the autist that you are lose it all but instead of losing 2000$ you write that sucker off on ur taxes and since ur income is now only 12000$ you don’t pay that higher tax bracket and that 2000$ yolo was only 600$.

[SwaggyStonks - WSB Analyzer and YOLO tracker.](https://www.swaggystocks.com)

&amp;#x200B;

It contains a WSB '**Sentiment' analyzer**, **Due Diligence** tracker, and a **YOLO tracker**.

I've recently added a new section that will contain full, in-depth ""Due Diligence"" reports on certain companies that will include all the data someone needs to know about the company if they want to trade their stock.

**Quick ""How it works""**

I log positions of posts flagged as ""YOLO/Gains/Losses"" and post them to my site. For actual options YOLO plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the win/loss percent. Every position on the site links back to it's appropriate thread on WallStreetBets so you can take a look and read the comments/juicy details as well! All other gains, losses, and expired YOLOs are placed in the ""Expired YOLOs"" section.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note I do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the OP of the YOLO disappears in which case I let the YOLO ride until expiry. It's fun to see what they could be worth!

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Cool Features The Site Has:**

\-**Top YOLO**s section (sorted by upvotes, gains, and losses)

\-**Competitor Analysis Tool**: Compare fundamentals/financials for different tickers.

\-**Options Scanner Tool**: View historical estimated ""prices"" of options. A good tool to view which options are currently expensive or cheap at different ranges of OTM.

\-**Credit Spread Finder**: Search tickers and find how much premium you can receive at 'x' percentage of being OTM and how much you are risking.

\-**Dividend Screener**: Search stocks that offer a dividend and filter them by: sector, dividend amount, and dividend frequency.

If anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!

#Introducing the r/wallstreetbets Hedge Fund!

We're over 700k in this sub, if we should all contribute $10 each, that'll give us $7million.

The money will be given to the manager of the fund (me of course) to invest in behalf of the sub!

Everybody will be a shareholder.

Now, using advanced strategies I've learned from the greats like u/Analfarmer2, u/1ronyman and u/ControlTheNarrative, I can expertly sell puts and buy calls, making us a shitload of tendies monthly.

I currently have $18.67 under management, projected  to grow exponentially, so you can tell I'm an expert and this can't go tits up.


Dividends will be distributed yearly to all members of the sub.

When it comes to gene-replacement, there aren’t very many options. You can either use Crispr, or modified viruses. The difference is similar to “cutting” &amp; “pasting” with a scalpel, versus exploding &amp; inserting with a bomb.
