In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

Matinas is an interesting company that has a prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid-based composition (similar to Vascepa) under development for reducing triglycerides (named MAT9001). Importantly it has shown superiority versus Amarin's Vascepa for the same indications..

Amarin’s stock has risen 10x over the past year as it has successfully progressed towards approval for Vascepa. Most recently an FDA expert panel unanimously to recommend Amarin's Vascepa for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke.

However back in 2015, Matinas was conducting a phase I trial of its own omega 3 drug MAT9001, comparing it directly with Vascepa. It found that MAT9001 was much more effective than Vascepa at reducing triglycerides and VLDL-C. MAT9001 saw a 33.2% reduction from baseline versus 10.5% for Vascepa, and VLDL-C reduction was at 32.5% versus 8.1% for Vascepa. Despite that trial's success, Matinas put MAT9001 on the backburner while it used its resources to develop its lead antifungal candidate.

The company has since revived MAT9001 with a 100-patient Phase II crossover head-to-head trial against Vascepa on patients with high triglycerides that will begin dosing next quarter, with results expected by the end of 2020.

There is no guarantee that it will succeed and even if it does the approval process will probably take a while. However the results so far are encouraging and the insider purchases send a clear signal that senior management is confident in success. 

The stock price has increased almost 100% but, with a market valuation of just $200 million compared to $7.63 billion for Amarin, there could be a lot more upside for investors who join the CFO and Vice Chairman.

More insider buying at **Assured Guaranty Ltd** on November 25th &amp; 26th as Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Feldstein, purchase another $1.9 million of stock. That brings the total number of purchases over the past month to 10. 

The company is a monoline guarantor that insures municipal and structured debt issuance. It ran into trouble during the great recession but has staged something of a recovery and Mr Feldstein seems to be highly confident in its future.

Two points of interest that caught my eye;

1. The company estimates it’s non GAAP adjusted book value at $90.18 compared to Fridays close at $49.65 (GAAP valuation of $68.94 also compares well)

2. The company CEO said on the Q2 earnings call that he believed the firm had $3.2 billion of excess capital beyond what was required to maintain its AAA rating. A meaningful amount for a company with a market capitalization of $4.7 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

On November 20th, Chief Executive Officer Lee Jacobson purchased $352,154 worth of **Nesco Holdings**, picking up the stock after a drop of almost 70% this year. 

Nesco is one of the largest specialty equipment rental providers to the electric utility transmission and distribution, telecom and rail industries in North America. It reported mixed Q3 results a couple of weeks ago with revenues down 2.6% and a loss of $18 million but the company generated solid revenue growth in both the equipment rental (up 7.3%) and parts, tools, and accessories businesses (up 51.2%), as well as the 13th consecutive quarter of growth in adjusted EBITDA (up 7.5%).

At the time Lee Jacobson, CEO of Nesco, remarked ""We continue to see considerable opportunities for organic growth, supported by growing customer backlogs within our core electric utility markets, increased market penetration of the rail and telecom markets and further penetration of the parts tools and accessories offering across our existing equipment rental customer base. Shortages for specialty rental equipment in the markets we serve have continued and our customer rental contract periods have lengthened to record levels, further supporting our planned investment in fleet growth.”

That looks like a good outlook from Mr Jacobson and, having almost doubled his shareholding, he has backed that up with his own cash. The stock has dropped a further 10% and, trading on 0.6x revenues, other investors may want to have a look too. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Comscore’s** new CEO, Bill Livek, snapped up $1 million of stock on November 12th (along with a few other insider purchases) following Q3 results. That should only enhance the strong incentives already in place for him to deliver a sale of the company at an advantageous value for investors. Livek, a 30-year veteran of the media and data measurement market, will receive a $1 million cash bonus from a sale. However, he will get an additional cash bonus (based on a percentage of the gross transaction if the sale yields $500 million or more in proceeds). That’s a 75% premium to Friday’s closing market capitalization of $286 million.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There was insider buying at **Zovio** on November 5th, by Chief Executive Officer Andrew S. Clark who purchased 150,000 shares for a cost of $2.58 each, for a total investment of $386,505. Zovio has fallen back to $2.30 since then but is up 44% since reporting Q3 results on October 31. 

On that call the education technology services company (and owner of online Ashford University) outlined a restructuring plan to drive cost savings totalling $51 million in 2020 and drive the company back to profitability with guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.50 to$0.90. If successful the current stock price of $2.02 would be a bargain. The CEO’s purchase is an encouraging endorsement.

BEIJING, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Beijing's top priority in any phase one trade deal with the United States is the removal of existing tariffs on Chinese goods, China's Global Times newspaper said on Sunday, amid continued uncertainty on whether the two sides can strike a deal.

""Sources with direct knowledge of the trade talks told the Global Times on Saturday that the U.S. must remove existing tariffs, not planned tariffs, as part of the deal,"" said the report.

Global Times, published by the official People's Daily newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, also cited another unidentified source close to the talks as saying U.S. officials had been resisting such a demand because the tariffs were their only weapon in the trade war and giving up that weapon meant ""surrender.""

On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington was in the ""final throes"" of a deal aimed at defusing a 16-month trade war with China, a few days after Chinese President Xi Jinping had expressed his desire for a trade agreement. Top trade negotiators for both countries also spoke again and agreed to continue working on the remaining issues.

Trade experts and people close to the White House told Reuters last month, however, that signing a phase one agreement may not take place until the new year as China pressed for more extensive rollbacks of tariffs. An agreement was initially expected to be completed by the end of November.

U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley told reporters on Tuesday that Beijing invited U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for in-person talks in Beijing.

Grassley said Lighthizer and Mnuchin were willing to go if they saw ""a real chance of getting a final agreement"".","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Beijing&amp;#39;s top priority in any phase one trade deal with the United States is the removal of existing tariffs on Chinese goods, China&amp;#39;s Global Times newspaper said on Sunday, amid continued uncertainty on whether the two sides can strike a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

A “simple” thing like eye color isn’t just in 1 place of your DNA, but is in several dozen places &amp;amp; the regions vary based on the individual. With increasingly better computing &amp;amp; AI, we’ve gotten better at understanding all of human DNA &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; to alter it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gene-editing has just begun, and it isn’t going away. People will alter their sequencing for both necessity &amp;amp; personal preferences in the future, and there will be a lot of money to be made in it. I recommend all long-term investors to hold some shares of CRSP, and I welcome short-term traders to ride the wave where they see potential to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I don&amp;#39;t understand are the market functions that are going to cause that stock to rise. Will the price increase simply because other investors are going to notice that the stock is undervalued relative to peers/industry? I find that really hard to believe given the efficient market hypothesis. Is it just random chance that the company will announce surprising positive news that will move the stock? But, if that&amp;#39;s the primary case, then why look for undervalued stocks at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate any input or insight!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking for a quite specific type of book about investing. I'm a college student, I've already had some finance / investing classes, and I'll have more in the future. I believe I know the basics, but I still have a lot to learn.

I'd like to read something that's entertaining and anecdotic but also educational at the same time (so basically something between The Wolf of Wall Street and a finance textbook). I would like the book to be centered around the valuable experience / wisdom of the writer, not just the raw explanation of certain theories. So far I've found One Up On Wall Street to be the best choice, but I figured I'd ask your opinion.

Thanks in advance!

An unprecedented frenzy of debt sales around the world is threatening to cool this year’s hot returns on corporate bonds.

Companies have sold a record $2.43 trillion so far this year across currencies, surpassing previous full-year records. Investors rushed to snap up all this debt because they were desperate for yield as central banks cut rates. That has pushed up valuations.

&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented frenzy of debt sales around the world is threatening to cool this year’s hot returns on corporate bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies have sold a record $2.43 trillion so far this year across currencies, surpassing previous full-year records. Investors rushed to snap up all this debt because they were desperate for yield as central banks cut rates. That has pushed up valuations.&lt;/p&gt;

1. Basically:  Are unrealized gains the best indicator of how much profits or losses you made when taking into consideration money spent and money gained/lost?

Other observations I noticed.

1. T. Rowe Price and Fidelity give you percentages of how much profit you made.  I noticed not all companies do something like this.  They will say something like you had a personal rate of return of 14%.   This is helpful.

It doesn't make sense to me because I used an excel sheet to relook this.  My total contributions were at $16,000.  If my total value is at $17,298.39, we are talking a difference of +$1,298 in profits (as a gain).  This should still be considered a win for me, though though not good considering how much money went into this.  I know where I am wrong though.  I'm not including the capital gain distributions and dividends into my $16,000 worth of contributions.  I guess I initially earned a lot of capital gain distributions and dividends, and then lost them much later.

I've read a lot about how there's a recession coming soon blah blah and people are liquidating their assets to prepare.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 31 years old with 41k in my investment account. I&amp;#39;ve been primarily looking at dividend stocks due to their ability to grow passively via dividend reinvesting. I started this way 3 years ago, but taken it more seriously the past year. Thus far, my portfolio has grown ~16% as of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read a lot about how there&amp;#39;s a recession coming soon blah blah and people are liquidating their assets to prepare. &lt;/p&gt;

MUNICH (Reuters) - Hedge funds control 35-45% of the shares of German lighting group Osram ([OSRn.DE](https://www.reuters.com/companies/OSRn.DE)), posing a headache for Austrian suitor AMS ([AMS.VI](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMS.VI)) as the investors may press for the $5 billion offer to be sweetened, a person close to the matter said on Thursday.

An initial bid by AMS to create a global leader in sensors and lights stumbled last month when it fell short of the necessary shareholder backing. Since then AMS has lowered the acceptance threshold to 55% to try to get the deal over the line, while keeping the offer price at 41 euros a share.

Osram Chief Executive Olaf Berlien told German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung that some investors seem to have no intention of tendering their shares by the Dec. 5 deadline.

“It appears that a number of hedge funds have acquired shares with the aim of selling them at a later date and at a higher price,” he told the newspaper, which first reported the stakes held by hedge funds.

German law allows for courts to determine that minority investors be compensated at a higher price for their shares when an acquirer and a target company strike a so-called domination agreement, which regularly prompts hedge funds to hold back shares aiming to benefit from a deferred sale.

However, if too many speculative investors decide to hold back shares that can lead to deals falling apart, as seen in initial failed attempts for a leveraged buyout of generics firm Stada. That deal eventually went through in 2017 after the offer price was bumped up.

AMS - which already controls 20% of Osram - said on Wednesday that 3.3% of Osram shares have been tendered so far.

On Oct 31, hedge fund Sand Grove Capital Management disclosed a 5.75% Osram stake.

Around 10% of Osram shares are held by exchange-traded funds, which according to German law, are not allowed to sell their stake as long as the takeover is not completed, banking sources have said.

Retail investors, which often ignore tender offers, hold 20%-25%, the sources have said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;MUNICH (Reuters) - Hedge funds control 35-45% of the shares of German lighting group Osram (&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/companies/OSRn.DE""&gt;OSRn.DE&lt;/a&gt;), posing a headache for Austrian suitor AMS (&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMS.VI""&gt;AMS.VI&lt;/a&gt;) as the investors may press for the $5 billion offer to be sweetened, a person close to the matter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

In the biggest-ever takeover in the luxury-goods industry, lvmh, a French global conglomerate, announced its acquisition of **Tiffany**, an American jeweller founded in 1837 and known for its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. lvmh is paying $16.9bn, more than the roughly $14.5bn that was suggested when the transaction was first mooted in late October. The deal represents a success for Bernard Arnault, lvmh’s boss and controlling shareholder, who had courted Tiffany for some time. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/lvmh-tests-the-limits-of-luxury).

## The magic trick

The flotation of **Alibaba’s** shares on the Hong Kong stockmarket raised $11.2bn, making it the most valuable share offering this year, ahead of the $8.1bn that Uber raked in at its ipo in May. The stock rose by 6.6% on the first day of trading in what is a secondary listing in Alibaba. Its shares are also listed in New York. See [article](https://www.economist.com/node/21775688).

**Uber** lost its licence to operate in London, again. The ride-hailing company has 45,000 drivers in the city, one of its biggest markets. London’s transport regulator raised more concerns about safety, including 14,000 fraudulent trips by unauthorised drivers. Uber is appealing against the decision and can continue to operate while it does so. See [article](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/11/27/london-hits-uber-hard-and-hails-a-fleet-of-new-cheaper-apps).

The chief executive of **Westpac** resigned and the chairman said he would step down next year, as Australia’s second-largest bank faced mounting criticism about its response to a money-laundering scandal. A regulator has accused Westpac of failing to monitor more than 23m suspect transactions, some of which enabled child exploitation in the Philippines. The bank has found itself in politicians’ cross-hairs. Australia’s treasurer said it had been indifferent to the scandal; the attorney-general noted that it was an “unbelievably serious” matter. Westpac has reportedly cancelled its Christmas party.

**Charles Schwab**, America’s biggest discount broker, struck a $26bn deal to acquire **td** **Ameritrade**, a rival. The pair had recently been engaged in a price war, both ditching the transaction fees they charged customers. The combined group will have around $5trn in client assets. See [article](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/11/30/charles-schwab-agrees-to-buy-td-ameritrade-for-26bn).

The **Brazilian real** fell to a new low against the dollar, after Brazil’s finance minister said he was “not worried” about a strong greenback. The slide prompted a brief intervention by the central bank to prop up the currency. The country’s current-account deficit has risen sharply this year, and interest rates have tumbled.

**Google** reportedly fired four employees who had been active in organising protests at the company and had apparently tried to gain access to private internal documents. The tech giant pioneered an office culture that mixes politics with work, which it may now regret. Vociferous staff have pressed management to drop an ai contract for the Pentagon and have walked out over sexual harassment and a search-engine project for the Chinese government. Their latest gripe is Google’s work for immigration enforcement. Google has told employees to tone it down and reduced staff meetings to one a month.

In an effort to boost profits and its feeble share price, **Telefónica** announced a plan to hive off its operations in Spanish-speaking Latin America and focus on its core markets in Spain, Brazil, Germany and Britain, where it brands itself as O2. The telecoms group also wants to expand its business in the internet of things and cloud computing.

On the lookout for new superdrugs that will replenish its portfolio, **Novartis** offered to buy **The Medicines Company** for $9.7bn. tmc’s crown jewel is inclisiran, a treatment that has been found to be highly effective in drug trials at reducing “bad” cholesterol, and which a patient needs to inject only twice a year. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/the-reinvention-of-novartis).

America’s Federal Aviation Administration said it alone would inspect the **737** max before it is returned to service, relieving Boeing of the exercise and signalling that it will sign off each jet individually. That could potentially extend the time frame that Boeing has in mind for resuming deliveries of the grounded aircraft to airlines.

**Tesla’s** share price struggled to recover from the drubbing it took after an unforeseen event at the launch of its new Cybertruck, which has been described as a cross between a futuristic car from “Blade Runner” and a SpongeBob SquarePants character. The vehicle’s supposedly armoured-glass windows shattered when a steel ball was hurled at them during a demonstration. “Maybe that was a little too hard,” said a startled Elon Musk, Tesla’s boss.

Lee Sedol, a Go champion, who in 2016 lost a celebrated match against AlphaGo, an **artificial-intelligence** program, announced his retirement. ai programs now compete in tournaments.

It was OK but the rules of the contest (no options trading, 30 min delay on purchases) plus the fact it was paper made me lose interest fairly quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

I discovered Robinhood and in June 2018 I decided to start my own contest using real money.   I tried to get others interested, but they were skeptical of Robinhood.   I then decided to just set a goal.   Start off with $2,500 (I figured I needed at least $2000 to stay above min levels for buying power) and try to turn it into $250,000 in a ten year contest time frame.   This sounds very difficult at first until you realize it is only a 60% return needed each year, compounded yearly.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today and I am at $16,200.   I have not YOLO'd any trades or used short term options.  I have used LEAPs and have invested in some biotech, which is quite volatile.   Hitting the $25,000 mark will be nice because it will open up the account past the 3 trade limit.   I am not super happy with the volatility but I am happy with the gain.   I usually try for only a couple hundred dollar gain per trade, taking advantage of the zero commissions and high volatility in biotech.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this doesn't really fit in r/investing but it doesn't really qualify for r/wallstreetbets either.   It is from someone who has 99% of their investments in index funds and just has a tiny gambling itch they want to scratch.   I don't even have a plan for the $250,000 but it needs to be something worthy, like a trip to Antarctica or a ride on Virgin Galactic.

-Rakuten, biggest Japanese online retail store, shows optimism in the market


If you are a fan of soccer, especially of FC Barcelona, you might have noticed a brand label “Rakuten” printed on the team’s uniform. It sounds like a Japanese combat video game (Tekken) or a Japanese anime about a blade battle (Bakuten Shoot Beyblade). Indeed, Rakuten is one of the biggest homegrown online retail companies that competes against Amazon in Japan. Rakuten (“optimism” in Japanese) is pretty optimistic about its future.


Founded in 1997 by Hiroshi Mikitani, Rakuten has become the second-biggest online retail company in Japan. It took up a 20% share of the market in 2016 while Amazon did 23%, according to Euromonitor. (In the US, Amazon takes up more than 50% of the market share as of 2019.) Interestingly, just like its American rival, the giant Japanese brand not only focuses on online retailing but also branches out its business into many other different services: mobile payments, online banking, insurance, music streaming, video streaming, etc. In fact, the total annual sales of the company in Japan as of June 2019 were estimated to be US $31.7 billion, surpassing Amazon’s US $25.42 billion sales. 


So, what makes Rakuten competitive? Many business experts say that Rakuten’s uniqueness makes the company thrive. First, unlike Amazon’s concise website that shows items related to the user’s past purchases on the main page, Rakuten bombards its main page with products that are not necessarily relevant to the user’s preference. And the website gives the sellers much leeway to go on a litany in the product description. While this renounces the “simplicity” many business models pursue these days, it is known to appeal to conventional customers who like window shopping and delving into the details of products. Second, Rakuten gives customers points when they purchase products or use any of its services. (Rakuten styles the entire chain of services as “Rakuten World”). Afterward, customers can use those accumulated points at any of its 40-odd subsidiaries. Rakuten is known to offer the most efficient point system in Japan. 


While many predict that Amazon and Rakuten will equally dominate the Japanese online retail market, the rise of Yahoo Japan should be heeded. Z Holdings Corp. and South Korea-based Naver Corp. on Nov. 18 announced their plans for a merger of Yahoo Japan and LINE, their respective subsidiaries. (LINE is Japan’s most popular messenger app with 194 million global users.) Experts predict that Yahoo Japan can optimize its online retail business through a merger with LINE. In addition, the company just took over Zozo, Japan’s biggest online fashion retailer, in September. Yahoo Japan was estimated to take up a 10% share of the online retail sector in 2016, third after Amazon and Rakuten.


Whatever may happen at Yahoo Japan or Amazon, Rakuten founder Mikitani is content with his company’s direction. “As far as our gross is concerned, we are growing at the right speed,” he said  in an interview with Bloomberg about losing market share to Amazon in March 2019. Investors are curious to see if the CEO will stay optimistic about his company’s future in Japan.

&lt;p&gt;-Rakuten, biggest Japanese online retail store, shows optimism in the market&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of soccer, especially of FC Barcelona, you might have noticed a brand label “Rakuten” printed on the team’s uniform. It sounds like a Japanese combat video game (Tekken) or a Japanese anime about a blade battle (Bakuten Shoot Beyblade). Indeed, Rakuten is one of the biggest homegrown online retail companies that competes against Amazon in Japan. Rakuten (“optimism” in Japanese) is pretty optimistic about its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1997 by Hiroshi Mikitani, Rakuten has become the second-biggest online retail company in Japan. It took up a 20% share of the market in 2016 while Amazon did 23%, according to Euromonitor. (In the US, Amazon takes up more than 50% of the market share as of 2019.) Interestingly, just like its American rival, the giant Japanese brand not only focuses on online retailing but also branches out its business into many other different services: mobile payments, online banking, insurance, music streaming, video streaming, etc. In fact, the total annual sales of the company in Japan as of June 2019 were estimated to be US $31.7 billion, surpassing Amazon’s US $25.42 billion sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what makes Rakuten competitive? Many business experts say that Rakuten’s uniqueness makes the company thrive. First, unlike Amazon’s concise website that shows items related to the user’s past purchases on the main page, Rakuten bombards its main page with products that are not necessarily relevant to the user’s preference. And the website gives the sellers much leeway to go on a litany in the product description. While this renounces the “simplicity” many business models pursue these days, it is known to appeal to conventional customers who like window shopping and delving into the details of products. Second, Rakuten gives customers points when they purchase products or use any of its services. (Rakuten styles the entire chain of services as “Rakuten World”). Afterward, customers can use those accumulated points at any of its 40-odd subsidiaries. Rakuten is known to offer the most efficient point system in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many predict that Amazon and Rakuten will equally dominate the Japanese online retail market, the rise of Yahoo Japan should be heeded. Z Holdings Corp. and South Korea-based Naver Corp. on Nov. 18 announced their plans for a merger of Yahoo Japan and LINE, their respective subsidiaries.

Analysts at the investment bank see prices pushing to $1,600 an ounce next year. The price of gold currently sits at $1459.62. That is a nearly 10% gain from present day prices. December gold futures are trading at about $1,456.70 an ounce.

On Sunday, the investment bank stated in a report that it likes the precious metal for 2020, because investors are looking for alternative investment assets.

“Investment deficit creates excess savings, supporting gold. In theory, savings should equal investment, but due to this decline in capex and a rise in precautionary cash balances, a savings surplus is beginning to develop that is supporting gold prices,” the analysts wrote. “When combined with 750 tonnes of central bank gold purchases related to de-dollarization and defensive portfolio rotations, the savings glut means we maintain our bullish gold stance in 2020 with a target of $1600/toz..”

The investment bank’s analysts believe that heightened global uncertainty, along with slowing economic growth, could support gold prices. Recession concerns remain, moreover, according to the analysts. Increasing inflation, as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low, could buoy gold prices. A potential flight from the dollar could also help support the gold price.

Goldman Sachs is less bullish on silver for 2020. The investment bank does see prices increasing to $18 an ounce, a gain of 6.5% over current prices.

“Outside of investment demand, silver fundamentals remain challenged as industrial demand contracted and mine supply, while flat this year, is expected to grow strongly in 2020,” the analysts said. “While we expect investor interest in the precious space to be high in 2020 it will likely be less than during 2H19 when recession fears spiked.

source: https://goldsilverbitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-gold-prediction-2020/","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has a bullish outlook on gold. Analysts at the investment bank see prices pushing to $1,600 an ounce next year. The price of gold currently sits at $1459.62. That is a nearly 10% gain from present day prices. December gold futures are trading at about $1,456.70 an ounce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the investment bank stated in a report that it likes the precious metal for 2020, because investors are looking for alternative investment assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Investment deficit creates excess savings, supporting gold. In theory, savings should equal investment, but due to this decline in capex and a rise in precautionary cash balances, a savings surplus is beginning to develop that is supporting gold prices,” the analysts wrote. “When combined with 750 tonnes of central bank gold purchases related to de-dollarization and defensive portfolio rotations, the savings glut means we maintain our bullish gold stance in 2020 with a target of $1600/toz..”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment bank’s analysts believe that heightened global uncertainty, along with slowing economic growth, could support gold prices. Recession concerns remain, moreover, according to the analysts. Increasing inflation, as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low, could buoy gold prices. A potential flight from the dollar could also help support the gold price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is less bullish on silver for 2020. The investment bank does see prices increasing to $18 an ounce, a gain of 6.5% over current prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Outside of investment demand, silver fundamentals remain challenged as industrial demand contracted and mine supply, while flat this year, is expected to grow strongly in 2020,” the analysts said. “While we expect investor interest in the precious space to be high in 2020 it will likely be less than during 2H19 when recession fears spiked. In such an environment while gold investment can continue to grow silver often gets overlooked being the marginal precious metal.”&lt;/p&gt;

I was just wondering if it's possible to set it up through a Limited Company and then buy these stocks through an eTorro/Robinhood style platform etc.

The reason we want to do it like this is so if anything happens to one of us the company will still be there, have it as a 50/50 split, and if we want to add my other brother or other family members we can.

I am not an expert on the company. I can see it has a number of commercial and late stage non-opioid pain therapies as well as four immuno-oncology (treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer) programs in development. Management as usual believe that these have a great outlook for growth. To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $419 million (after the recent increase).

However it is the apparent enthusiasm by two unrelated outsiders to make an unsolicited bid having seen (I assume) Sorrento’s plans for development that is key for me. 

The stock is currently valued at $2.97. That compares to the 2 rejected bids of $3 and $5, two analyst target prices of $21 and $28 and represents a valuation that is approximately 10% of the fast growing non-opioid therapy target market. 

It is often difficult to judge individuals motivations but when two operators in the sector get inside information and put in a bid at prices above the current price it sends a strong signal that the company is undervalued.

Net income soared by 86% to $621 million or $1.50 per share. The latest quarter included an unrealized gain of $249 million on an investment in Pivotal Software. Adjusted earnings decreased by 4% to $1.49 per share.

Revenue grew by 12% to $2.46 billion. License revenue increased by 10% to $974 million. The results reflected broad-based strength across its product and solutions portfolio.

Hybrid Cloud Subscription and SaaS revenue grew to over 13% of total revenue in Q3, and the company expects this category to continue to grow significantly next year, including the contributions of Carbon Black and Pivotal.

For the third quarter, the company continued to see traction and customer momentum in support of VMware’s vision to deliver a software architecture that enables any app, on any cloud, delivered to any device. The company remained on track to close the acquisition of Pivotal Software by the end of the fiscal year.

For the quarter, software maintenance services revenue increased by 12.5% year-over-year to $1.28 billion. Professional services revenue grew by 13.5% to $202 million. Services accounted for 60% of the total revenue while license accounted for just 40%.

**Global Equities**

* We see a China-led stabilization of ex-US growth and the pause in US monetary policy tightening as key to prolonging the business cycle, just as they were in early 2016. In particular we view the probability of a recession in the coming year as low given the strength of labor markets and consumption across the developed world. We believe that the global economic growth is stabilizing around its trend rate.
* After inconsistent Fed rhetoric prompted fears of a US monetary policy mistake in late 2018, a clearer and unequivocally more accommodative Fed narrative has emerged. In our view, the Fed is now likely to let the US economy 'run hot' in order to rebase inflation expectations. With scant evidence of significant momentum in US core inflation, the Fed has considerable breathing room.
*  The ability of China to cushion its slowdown continues to be key to the global economy and markets. The Chinese authorities have a broad range of policy tools at their disposal and have shown willingness to use the full breadth in achieving a difficult balancing act between de-risking a highly leveraged and capital inefficient Chinese economy and softening the slowdown prompted by those deleveraging initiatives.
* In our view, risk assets discounted material concerns about factors including the potential impact of a protracted US/China trade war at the start of the year. The speed and scale of the rally in the face of disappointing macro data globally and downgrades to forward corporate earnings expectations suggest strongly that expectations for good news on US/China trade talks have now been largely priced in. We remain constructive on global equities, but the speed and scale of the rally in 2019 has tempered to a degree the conviction of that positive view. The likelihood of further material upside for risk assets in the short term is, in our view, now dependent on the ability of ex-US demand growth to accelerate from current weak levels to support earnings. In particular, the effectiveness of the broad array of measures progressed by the Chinese authorities to cushion their growth slowdown remains critical.
* We retain a negative view overall on developed world duration over the medium term. With global growth showing signs of stabilization, we think it is too soon for the market to be pricing material easing from the Fed, although the risks around this view have increased with apparent Fed determination to boost inflation and inflation expectations. Across the Atlantic, we are unconvinced that the ECB will be unable to tighten this cycle. In our view, yield curves are likely to steepen as global growth rebounds along with inflation expectations. While wage growth has yet to materially impact core inflation measures, developed world labor markets continue to tighten. We see nominal yields moving gradually higher as output gaps close, wage growth accelerates and the global economy stabilizes. However, upside to nominal yields is likely limited by structural factors including fast ageing populations in the developed world and technology-driven price pressures.

**US Equities**

* During the first few months of the year, US equities benefited from a resilient domestic economy and a lower exposure to global growth factors compared to other major indices. While we do expect US stocks to remain supported by easy to beat consensus earnings expectations and solid US consumer demand, the recent pickup in Chinese exports and manufacturing activity should support ex-US stocks to a larger degree as they exhibit higher cyclicality and trade reliance. US equities trade at a premium relative to other markets leaving less room for further rerating.

**Global (Ex-US) Equities**

*  In Europe, growth has decelerated considerably, due to external and domestic factors. Externally, China's slowdown and trade uncertainty negatively affected European exports. Domestically, political upheaval in Italy and France along with disruptive auto emissions regulations weighed on the economy. However, we expect those headwinds to fade over the coming months. European stocks remain supported by solid domestic demand dynamics, attractive valuations and by a likely stabilization of global economic 
conditions towards the second half of 2019.
* We remain constructive on Japanese equities despite the recent headwinds from weak Chinese imports. Diminished political uncertainties and ongoing structural reforms are supportive of higher price multiples while a solid underlying domestic economy suggests the outlook for profits is stronger than markets are discounting.

**Emerging Markets (EM) Equities including China**

* Emerging market equities have this year underperformed developed market equities driven by a continued deterioration in earnings but the surge in Chinese social financing bodes well for EM growth over coming months.
* We remain broadly positive on China in the expectation of further measures to cushion the domestic growth slowdown. Any broadening of the current trade stand-off with the US is likely to hamper Chinese growth, but a gradual economic slowdown is already priced in and the Chinese authorities have already shown themselves willing to provide monetary, fiscal and regulatory support to help smooth the ongoing economic transition. Chinese equities still trade at a PE discount to other markets and further market liberalization could prompt a rerating as international capital starts to flow into Chinese assets following the inclusion of onshore Chinese equities in MSCI's widely followed EM equity indices.

**Currency**

* As signs of stimulus from China begin to take hold, we expect ex-US growth to stabilize. Over time, we anticipate capital will flow from the US into earlier-cycle economies and that the USD will weaken, especially as the USD remains somewhat expensive on a real trade-weighted basis. Elsewhere, we continue to see strong valuation support for the JPY and see short AUD as an effective hedge against ongoing China weakness in an economy where domestic household leverage is likely to constrain growth.

**US Bonds**

* After the recent downward repricing of US rate expectations, 10yr nominal US Treasury yields appear reasonably value given our outlook. Nonetheless, US nominal yields look attractive relative to most other developed government bond markets on an unhedged basis. In the absence of a material pickup in inflation or term premium, yields are likely to remain range bound. Our overall assessment is neutral.

**Global (Ex-US) Bonds**

* In aggregate, we see global sovereign bonds outside of the US as unattractive. The ECB has committed to low rates for some time, limiting attractiveness of core Euro area bonds. We find Italian BTPs attractive on diminishing political risks. Swiss bonds continue to look very overvalued and in our view they have an increasingly asymmetric risk profile. The Swiss economy is relatively strong and we see Swiss bonds as vulnerable to attempts to normalize monetary policy by a Swiss National Bank increasingly concerned by the strength of the housing market.
* Elsewhere we are more positive on Australian duration on a relative basis. We see the Reserve Bank of Australia taking a cautious approach to policy given elevated household leverage and slow inflation.

**Investment Grade (IG) Corporate Debt**

* Although we do not believe that a sharp demand slowdown is imminent, we believe IG spreads troughed for the cycle in early 2018. Moreover, we are concerned about increased supply, reduced demand, and potentially large number of ""fallen angels"" when the economic growth takes slows down significantly and downgrades begin.

**US High Yield Bonds**

* Current default rates in high yield are very low by historical standards. Given the still relatively positive economic backdrop, we do not expect a material pick-up in US defaults in the near term. However, after the significant recent rally, spreads have now tightened to a point where we see the balance of risks skewed towards more widening.

**Emerging Markets Debt**

* Spreads on EM debt relative to US Treasuries widened substantially in 2018 in the face of higher geopolitical risks, a strengthening USD and higher USD funding rates. However, EM local currency bond yields have rallied both in absolute terms and relative to the US yields since September while EM hard currency bonds yields began a rally in late November. This reflects investor expectations for a less hawkish Fed, less aggressive US trade policy, and/or more China stimulus.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=""https://www.ubs.com/us/en/asset-management/individual-investors-and-financial-advisors/2018/market-commentary/_jcr_content/mainpar/toplevelgrid/col1/actionbutton.1008065114.file/bGluay9wYXRoPS9jb250ZW50L2RhbS91YnMvdXMvYXNzZXQtbWFuYWdlbWVudC9wZGYvbWFjcm8tbW9udGhseS1jdXJyZW50LnBkZg==/macro-monthly-current.pdf""&gt;UBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a bit desperate, so I hope I'm posting this in the right place. My mum invested in a company called cryptoadvice and I need to know if this is a scam. It sure feels like one...

Some background info:

Forgive me, but I could not gather that much info of now. What I know is that my mother met a woman not that long ago who she quickly became ""friends"" with. This woman now convinced her to invest in something called ""cryptoadvice"".

My mother never had much money, she is living in a small apartment and in a few years she will get a laughable pension. When she found out how little it was, she was crushed. Suddenly this woman presented her with the idea of taking money out of her life insurance and investing it. My mum fell for it and invested the money she had saved. Now she wants to invest even more. If this is a scam I need to stop her!

What will follow now is a wall of text on what I could dig up so far. But the TLDR of this post is:

**If you can find out something about this or you by chance have any experience with this ""cryptoadvice company"" please help me. My mum wants to invest even more money there by tonight and I have to gather any information I can on them!**

What I found out about cryptoadvice so far (please bear with me, I don't know shit about crypto currency):

Cryptoadvice seems to offer Blockchain trading and Investment platform for investors. I don't know any of these terms, but words that I came across are:

Forex trading

Margin trading

Margin lending

Crypto Bonds

ICO

Dice Games (this seems to be something shady/bad?)
**
Also: If you as an investor get someone else to invest in this too, you get a provision of 5% of the deposit.**

For this section I'm using a translator, because I found it in a german article and can't translate it fully myself:

The business model offered by cryptoadvice is not based on any retail products or services that have to be rebuilt over and over again. This makes the investment in CryptoAdvice highly risky, because it would depend, for example, on failed investments by the influx of ever new funds.

On the website of Crytoadvice can be found in the imprint of the company Mended Minds Ltd. based in London. The company apparently entered in business register in 2018 in Cardiff, Wales. The website went online in 2018. These are Mendes Minds Ltd. with the brand CryproAdvice to a company not regulated by the FCA.

This is problematic because whenever the investors' money is invested by the investment managers of a company, and thus there is no pure intermediary activity, under European law licensing and regulation by the competent financial supervisory authority is required. On the one hand, while there is talk of CryptoAdvice being a platform, on the other hand, money or crypto-money is being talked about by in-house investment managers.

CEO of CryptoAdvice is Jordan Lucas. This is a real person who has nothing to do with American football player Jordan Lucas of Kansas City. Of course, we did not know if the name was real, but the person on the webpage is the same as the presentations in some YouTube videos. At the events, juicy checks are handed over to cheers and the mood is heated up with a view to top returns and epoch-making sound. This sounds super obvious to me...

The connection with QuickX behind the QCX token also makes us listen. QuickX is a Malta-based company, also part of Mended Minds Ltd. and Jordan Luke. QuickX and QCX tokens are obviously also linked to an Indian development team. The QXC tokens will obviously be pushed through the affiliate program as well as with the investments by CryptoAdvice.

Affiliate partners, for example, have to deposit QCX tokens to get the returns paid out in QCX as well. However, the QCX investments are committed for one year. This means that no payouts can be made for at least one year. The lock is justified by the fact that no price decline of the QCX should take place. That is, however, with pure folly mischief.

The one-year ban on withdrawals, it may be suspected in critical view, could also have been added as a brake for a premature collapse of a ""house of cards"". However, since we do not want to work with guesses, it remains with the indication that the justification for the one-year lock is rationally incomprehensible.
**
So to me this sounds like a scam where people are talked into investing in ""cryptoadvice"" by people who already did so and are now trying to get the 5% by recruiting other investors.**

I hope someone can help me here, I'm sorry for the long post.

Edit: Found a video of someone looking into the company. Maybe he can explain the company a little better:

This means that no payouts can be made for at least one year. The lock is justified by the fact that no price decline of the QCX should take place. That is, however, with pure folly mischief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one-year ban on withdrawals, it may be suspected in critical view, could also have been added as a brake for a premature collapse of a &amp;quot;house of cards&amp;quot;. However, since we do not want to work with guesses, it remains with the indication that the justification for the one-year lock is rationally incomprehensible.
**
So to me this sounds like a scam where people are talked into investing in &amp;quot;cryptoadvice&amp;quot; by people who already did so and are now trying to get the 5% by recruiting other investors.**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope someone can help me here, I&amp;#39;m sorry for the long post.&lt;/p&gt;

You see, bonds are not paying a lot of money. A measly 1.8% on 30 year treasuries? As the basketball players would say, “swerve”.  I do not even stop to pick up 1.8% off the ground! Conversely, many reputable dividend stocks are paying 2, 3, even four percentage points!

1. What if...... you never sold it? 
2. Heh...you don’t think prices of bonds don’t change?

Bonds are basically as volatile as equities when you think about interest rates. You do not think that precious safe bond might turn around and just fucking stab you in the fucking back?!

I'm thinking that, assuming my investment portfolio meets or exceeds $12,500 gains, I could sell it at the end of each year to claim the income in order to qualify for the tax credit and not have to pay the penalty for not making enough money. 

In addition, the standard deduction would mean that I would not have to pay tax on the income up to $12,500.

Some excerpts

&gt;Business activity in the U.S. is offering signs of a pickup in late 2019, contrasting with more sluggish economic performances in some of the world’s other largest economies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Data company IHS Markit said Friday that its composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for the U.S., a measure of activity in businesses, posted a four-month high of 51.9 in November, up from 50.9 in October. A level above 50 points to growth in business activity, while a reading below that mark points to contraction.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The worst of the economy’s recent soft patch may be behind us,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, referring to the U.S. economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Thursday it expects the eurozone economy to grow by 1.2% this year, and the Japanese economy to expand by 1%. It expects the U.S. economy to grow by 2.3%. All three are forecast to slow slightly in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Paris-based research body, which represents 36 advanced economies, said those low rates of growth could become standard if governments don’t roll back newly erected obstacles to trade and take steps to boost investment.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;In the eurozone, weakness in manufacturing showed signs of spilling over to the services sector. In the U.S., services have remained more resistant to such spillover, with much of the economic weakness this year contained to the relatively small manufacturing sector.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/slowing-business-activity-sounds-alarm-for-global-economy-11574417281?mod=hp_major_pos3""&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the eurozone, weakness in manufacturing showed signs of spilling over to the services sector. In the U.S., services have remained more resistant to such spillover, with much of the economic weakness this year contained to the relatively small manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the primary rules in using a data driven approach to “forecast” future performance is to try to predict expected standard deviation before anything else.

I also understand forecasting expected returns to be a mathematically impossible task beyond the likes of historical performance (which sucks in quality), equity research (super expensive) or CAPM (derived from risk). A fundamental rule of quantitative finance is that there is no significant autocorrelation among any liquid assets returns across any regular time interval.

I was hoping to harness the collective wisdom of this subreddit in understanding the implications or different number of open/closed credit lines and also considering this relationship to ones revolving credit balance when evaluating a P2P investment:

Now I want to understand, hypothetically if I was issuing a loan to someone on a p2p basis and was evaluating their credit worthiness:

1. Say they have 20 total credit lines of which 10 are currently open. Would a smart way to evaluate this be to consider how long they've had a credit score? (since over time one opens and closes additional accounts over time)
2. In reviewing their revolving credit balance, I feel a good way to evaluate their credit worthiness could be to consider it in regard to their monthly gross income or monthly net income and seeing the ratio of revolving balance to monthly net income,   
The logic being that say for whatever reason they are required to pay down all their debt then if their revolving credit balance is greater than their monthly net income already then the probability of me getting my loan and interest payments are going to be fairly low.

An add on point to this: What if we divide the monthly revolving credit balance by number of open credit lines? Because people can keep opening credit lines to prevent paying off their dues so a higher value may indicate that this is not a practice that this borrower indulges in, boosting their credit worthiness.

I'm a self educated investor, learning how to understand Wallstreet and investing via this sub reddit, twitter, youtube videos, and books. I am putting as much of my meager wages toward asset growth as I possibly can, but it isn't much. I come from a lower middle class, blue collar family. We were very poor. I've worked a job and have paid into social security since I was 14 years old. I am smack in the middle between Generation X and the Millennials. I am writing this to get something off my chest, because I don't think my Xennial POV is talked enough about in investing, and yet its crucial to understand in order to understand where the economy is headed and point out the blindspots in current economic policy.

The reason I give all of this background is because I feel that a majority of the people dealing with Wallstreet and investing do not understand how precarious the current economic situation is. I believe this is because the inequality gap between the upper and middle/lower classes has widened substantially in the last 10 years, and in addition to that, the generational wealth gap is substantial. I want to give my perspective from a lower to middle class person, that has watched economic cycles for the last 30 years with great interest and no ability to capitalize on my insights.

My assertion is that the middle and lower classes never fully recovered from the last financial meltdown and this is changing economic behavior at a macro level. Here are why I think these things are true and why this very important financial fact is overlooked.

1.  The lower middle class has had a very hard time staying out of debt during the last 10 year bull market. Boomers have horded assets over the last 10 years and sold to make great profits, while wages for Gen X and younger have stagnated for the last 10 years, while concurrently, debt has accumulated in younger generations in an effort to keep up with the boomers and their inflating asset values. Take for example, the young couple that bought a house in 2006, went bankrupt and lost the house in 2009, and then who were able to repurchase an inflated asset again in 2016. This has happened across the board. Risk takers are once again being rewarded for irresponsible risk at the household level.

2.  The current climate in the job market is one of defensive gratitude to be fully employed and to have medical benefits that don't have high monthly premiums. The current attitude for the younger generation employed full time in jobs is LOW RISK and stability minded employees that will take less pay for guaranteed stability and affordable benefits. Jobs are also highly specialized and skilled, taking years to master. Changing jobs usually requires a large investment of time and effort to learn. This is why despite low unemployment, there isn't a lot of job hopping happening. Younger generations need stability to make their monthly payments. They aren't going to risk changing jobs in an overly optimistic job market when it feels, sounds, and looks the same as the market did in 2007 and they still feel poor and vulnerable to economic change.

3.  Over the last 10 years, the lower to middle class has been targeted heavily by high risk, interest rate dependent, debt loads such as mortgages, car loans, and personal loans. Loans are everywhere. Cheap and easy money is everywhere, regardless of credit history. This makes the lower and middle classes look better off than they are, just like it did back in 2007-08.

4.  As boomers asset values and the stock market asset prices have risen dramatically, asset ownership of younger people has become unattainable because its out of reach financially. HOWEVER, that hasn't stopped banks from continuing to offer cheap loans to those that can barely afford them. A person that makes under 70 grand a year can get a mortgage worth 300,000. Its not hard to do the math, and figure out that if that person has one financial issue, they will not be able to make that mortgage payment consistently every month. The same can be said for credit card debt, car loans, and personal loans.

5.  Unless you have a perfect credit record, and you are disciplined or lucky to have a thrift mindset, you have felt that you need to take on this debt, and you don't have a choice because you can't make ends meet any other way. As rents have risen, and car financing has gotten cheaper then buying used (per monthly payment when you need to buy a car on time), you took the risk and put on the debt knowing that the only way to keep your transportation needs and housing needs met is to continue to hold debt. This debt stretches the lower to middle class very thin, but it has been necessary to keep food on the table and houses over their heads. Add on top of that, there is record setting student loan debt. As long as we are burdened with this debt, we cannot and will not think about asset ownership. As a result, asset ownership is shifting to the upper classes and has been for awhile.

6.  Many Millennials aren't fully participating in the labor force. They have lived in the lowest starting wage environment for young adults in modern history when adjusted for inflation. They are opting out of raising kids, owning homes, or purchasing large ticket items because they don't believe in the stability of their wages far into the future. Tack on top of their meager wages and no asset ownership the increase in medical costs, and lack of wage increases. Millennials are prudent. Millennials are thrifty, and yet they get sucked into the same traps as Xers when they try to keep up with the financial status quo set by their Boomer parents. They chase the American dream and buy more than they can afford, but less enthusiastically than their parents. They save money. They believe in ethical responsibility. They don't believe in corporate goodness or monopolies but reluctantly have to use them to provide food and shelter for themselves. The lower to middle class Xers were anti corporations and Millenials are anti consumer overall. The majority reject the status quo and don't expect to ever retire or have many assets. This is a devastating point of view for the future economic reality! This mindset is very common on the west coast in large cities where housing is explosively expensive and out of reach of ownership for a majority of lower and middle class Millennials.


What does this do to the economy in the future as the boomers retire?

Lower and middle class consumers, under heavy debt load taken on while trying to keep up with the asset rich boomers and asset rich banks, are feeling the crunch every time economic policy shifts, even slightly. This fact in combination with the anti consumer, anti debt mindset of younger generations, combines in a combustible fuel that can ignite with any small changes in the economy. The inflated asset prices are out of reach for the younger generations, and they know it! They simply refuse to participate in that economy, period, and those that do will be under a debt load very difficult to bear. Unless wages rise quickly, this economic reality will get worse over time!

Future economic shocks can be caused from simple small changes, such as the Fed raising interest rates, a small number of people laid off who aren't able to make their monthly payments, people and companies that are over leveraged and have no emergency fund in the bank, or, a fully leveraged person or company over leveraging to the point where they can't make their monthly payments anymore because future income didn't stay consistent with forecasts. 

Why does debt and credit cycle matter to ALL of the economy in the future despite what prevailing economists think?

This isn't a problem exclusively limited to corporate and upper class debt, which is why I think this gets overlooked by economists consistently. CREDIT MATTERS. This is a problem among all sectors of the economy, and within all generations. What happens to a bank when more than one person is no longer able to make their debt payments because they took out a cash-out refinance of their home at the peak of the market in 2018, or took a personal loan from a bank to pay off accumulated credit card debt, or a car payment they can pay as long as they are employed but have no backup plan if they lose a job? Banks will not have enough money to pay their debts. You will find symptoms in places such as the repo market. Same can be said for coorporate debt and needing to pay their bills during an economic contraction. Its ugly all around for the economy overall.

Conclusion.

Just like the pre-crisis times of 2007-2008, there is a massive amount of optimism in Wallstreet about the debt burden and our ability to pay it off in government, consumer, and corporate debt, and yet there is a complete lack of understanding that the majority of households are completely tapped out, and one layoff in a household could cause a ripple effect that would cause them to default on a majority of their debts from multiple institutions. Unlike 2008-2009, we don't have the same prosperity and cushion to absorb an economic shock because the Fed never raised interest rates high enough to get their target 4%. 

The activity in the repo market for banks is a mystery to people that don't understand what is happening at the micro level in individual households. It was a mystery to people in the banking industry in 2008-2009 when nobody was looking at the obvious housing market pump that occurred when banks and individuals were willing to take on debt loads they had no hope of paying off, and a lot of the lenders did it knowing full well it was unethical, if not illegal. The predatory nature of those loans was never discussed in full by a majority share of banks, and I assert that the same predatory greed mechanisms that led to the housing crisis will lead to the same result in all debt in our current economy once a level headed mindset returns and the Fed stops printing money to boost the bond market. 

This bond market is awash in debt up to their eyeballs and continues to pile on more risk and leverage in a fury of gleeful greed. As a Xennial, its disgusting to watch all of this happen again. It disgusts me because I've never lived in an economy where I've been awarded for responsible financial policy in my own life. Since I've become an adult, I've never been able to make money off of my money. As soon as interest rates rise, and responsible and ethical savers start to make money off of their work ethic, it gets trampled on by the market of frothy greed.

This gleeful greed pattern over the last 20 years has severely inflated values of assets in housing prices and in stocks twice. Once in 2008 and once in 2019 and I'm frustrated that my generation will once again be asked to endure another financial collapse at the cost of everything we've gained in the last 10 years. For those that have never made it out of debt, and took on a boomeresque unaffordable debt burden, they are going to be screwed during the next downturn and bubble burst.

Please convince me this is wrong. Please convince me that as a Xennial, I have a bright financial future to look forward to if I refuse to take on debt and I won't over leverage or bet my future to purchase assets I can't afford and that are inflated beyond what I can comprehend as logical.

I admit that when I write this, I feel a bit of anger. I have a 401k, and what little I've saved between 2009 and now, I want to keep. There is NO WHERE for me to put my money to protect it from the greed of others during the next downturn. I have no 401k funds that will keep my money safe in a cash equivalent fund. All of the available funds include shitty debt such as non investment grade bonds. I'm worried that if this asset and debt bubble bursts, I'll be back to square one yet again, and have nothing to retire on when I hit 65.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce myself by stating that I am not a financial guru.

They simply refuse to participate in that economy, period, and those that do will be under a debt load very difficult to bear. Unless wages rise quickly, this economic reality will get worse over time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future economic shocks can be caused from simple small changes, such as the Fed raising interest rates, a small number of people laid off who aren&amp;#39;t able to make their monthly payments, people and companies that are over leveraged and have no emergency fund in the bank, or, a fully leveraged person or company over leveraging to the point where they can&amp;#39;t make their monthly payments anymore because future income didn&amp;#39;t stay consistent with forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does debt and credit cycle matter to ALL of the economy in the future despite what prevailing economists think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a problem exclusively limited to corporate and upper class debt, which is why I think this gets overlooked by economists consistently. CREDIT MATTERS. This is a problem among all sectors of the economy, and within all generations. What happens to a bank when more than one person is no longer able to make their debt payments because they took out a cash-out refinance of their home at the peak of the market in 2018, or took a personal loan from a bank to pay off accumulated credit card debt, or a car payment they can pay as long as they are employed but have no backup plan if they lose a job? Banks will not have enough money to pay their debts. You will find symptoms in places such as the repo market. Same can be said for coorporate debt and needing to pay their bills during an economic contraction. Its ugly all around for the economy overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the pre-crisis times of 2007-2008, there is a massive amount of optimism in Wallstreet about the debt burden and our ability to pay it off in government, consumer, and corporate debt, and yet there is a complete lack of understanding that the majority of households are completely tapped out, and one layoff in a household could cause a ripple effect that would cause them to default on a majority of their debts from multiple institutions. Unlike 2008-2009, we don&amp;#39;t have the same prosperity and cushion to absorb an economic shock because the Fed never raised interest rates high enough to get their target 4%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activity in the repo market for banks is a mystery to people that don&amp;#39;t understand what is happening at the micro level in individual households. It was a mystery to people in the banking industry in 2008-2009 when nobody was looking at the obvious housing market pump that occurred when banks and individuals were willing to take on debt loads they had no hope of paying off, and a lot of the lenders did it knowing full well it was unethical, if not illegal. The predatory nature of those loans was never discussed in full by a majority share of banks, and I assert that the same predatory greed mechanisms that led to the housing crisis will lead to the same result in all debt in our current economy once a level headed mindset returns and the Fed stops printing money to boost the bond market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bond market is awash in debt up to their eyeballs and continues to pile on more risk and leverage in a fury of gleeful greed. As a Xennial, its disgusting to watch all of this happen again. It disgusts me because I&amp;#39;ve never lived in an economy where I&amp;#39;ve been awarded for responsible financial policy in my own life. Since I&amp;#39;ve become an adult, I&amp;#39;ve never been able to make money off of my money. As soon as interest rates rise, and responsible and ethical savers start to make money off of their work ethic, it gets trampled on by the market of frothy greed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gleeful greed pattern over the last 20 years has severely inflated values of assets in housing prices and in stocks twice. Once in 2008 and once in 2019 and I&amp;#39;m frustrated that my generation will once again be asked to endure another financial collapse at the cost of everything we&amp;#39;ve gained in the last 10 years. For those that have never made it out of debt, and took on a boomeresque unaffordable debt burden, they are going to be screwed during the next downturn and bubble burst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please convince me this is wrong. Please convince me that as a Xennial, I have a bright financial future to look forward to if I refuse to take on debt and I won&amp;#39;t over leverage or bet my future to purchase assets I can&amp;#39;t afford and that are inflated beyond what I can comprehend as logical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit that when I write this, I feel a bit of anger. I have a 401k, and what little I&amp;#39;ve saved between 2009 and now, I want to keep. There is NO WHERE for me to put my money to protect it from the greed of others during the next downturn. I have no 401k funds that will keep my money safe in a cash equivalent fund. All of the available funds include shitty debt such as non investment grade bonds. I&amp;#39;m worried that if this asset and debt bubble bursts, I&amp;#39;ll be back to square one yet again, and have nothing to retire on when I hit 65.&lt;/p&gt;

- moderate eps growth
- high margins (around 22%)

Hello all hope you're having a great day and week :)

I've (20M) just started reading and learning about finances and investing as I was given the book ""Rich dad poor dad"" from my mother, it's really opened my eyes in terms of financial stability for my future which I think not enough young people do. I've become obsessed with reading this one book alone and looking into investing as a whole.

But before I dip my feet into the investing world, what are some good books/literature you would recommend a beginner to read. The only knowledge I have so far is from the book mentioned above and my own research on YouTube and some blogs online.

Would you recommend me to read up on the branching subjects of investing? Such as economics, accounting or even Politics?

&lt;p&gt;This represents $450 per year on a portfolio of $500,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or IBB (a biotech etf) which has a fee of 0.47%, which is $2350 per year on a $500,000 portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could replicate these funds with individual stock purchases now that we have commission free trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not worth it in the case of SPY, but certainly in the case of IBB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could create your own custom index fund.   Say you wanted a index fund comprised of only companies with CEOs under 40 years old or who are paid less than $500,000 per year any other criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a newspaper company, so like any other newspaper company in the age of internet advertising, it is suffering from a business standpoint. But I'd argue that the risk:reward is skewed in favor of the positive given that it has no major capital expenditure or working capital spend. In other words, the cash hoard is safe. It also pays a 6% dividend. 

It's currently priced at 0.4x PB by the consensus (i.e. sell-side analysts), which I'll be honest after much research I don't know how they've arrived at. It seems to be an arbitrary number plucked from the sky that approximates the current share price. If profits do improve, for instance during the coming festive season (where advertising tends to do well), the stock could receive a re-rating to... I don't know, maybe 0.5x book. That's a 25% return right there. If business conditions go south, however, I don't see them trading for much less than the cash on their balance sheet (i.e. the current price). Hence, the risk:reward seems skewed to the positive, in my view.

This could make for a decent position for someone looking to hedge with an EM stock. Buy it for the cash, keep it for the beta. Hope I've contributed to making someone's day with this!

I'll highlight a few of those concerns below:

1. Since the beginning of 2018 owning AA through Single-B, broadly speaking, has had a total return of \~10%, regardless of the credit rating. Owning CCC-rated and below securities has yielded you a LOSS of \~1.5%. In this period we have seen the Fed raise rates, then reverse, and have seen investors truly ""reach for yield"", see negative rates.
2. To tie into #1, you have performed BETTER (total return) by owning AA US corporate credit securities over Single-B rated debt since the beginning of 2018. Better performance with a significantly different risk profile. Again, this is a space where participants are ""reaching for yield"".
3. On r/economy, I highlighted a chart I put together to help monitor turns in US corporate credit. In 2018, between January and October, a blow-off like top occurred with the highest reading ever seen, since data was available dating back to 1997. This marked the peak, and ever since has fallen precipitously to levels seen during the following periods: Q4 2015, September 2008, and August 2000.

It's a simple assumption, but given history, I suspect in or around Q1 2020 will be a bit of a ""pain point"" for low(er) grade US credit: Single-B and BB-rated. Likely spreads are to really get good traction to the upside. It's my estimation that the easing in credit, regardless of the Fed, has peaked around the end of September of this year, 2019.

How this impacts equities, if at all, I have no clue, but I believe the cost of protection for equities, i.e. volatility, is EXPENSIVE (yes, expensive) when compared to the cost of protection against US credit, specifically spec grade, using HYG as a proxy. And for the record, I believe the cost of protection for equities (proxy, VIX) is ""too cheap"". Lastly, since I used HYG as a proxy, one may note that the largest sector exposure is communications at \~25%. Second and third are both Consumer sectors (non-cyclical and cyclical), making up some 30% of the holdings combined. Worth noting on where to watch.

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m a bit older, have been reasonably successful in my industry, and have a couple million dollars just sitting in cash. I want to put some of it to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep dreaming of just putting a million dollars on those strong companies above and waiting for 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ultimate goal being to eventually live a modest lifestyle off interest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m by no means a pro investor, not sure I can even be considered an amateur investor. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been investing into small cap individual stocks in my Roth IRA for the past several years.  I enjoy doing my own research (it's more of a hobby) but I'm trying to figure out where to draw the line so that I don't foolishly risk a comfortable retirement.

I am a 30 year-old federal employee with a $98,000 salary and my wife makes about $20,000 annually working part-time for the county.  Being government employees we are both guaranteed pensions, which is nice.  We are also contributing as follows for retirement:

**Thrift Savings Plan** ^(5% of gross income, about $800 per month with employer match)

* 45% [Common](https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_C.html)
* 25% [Small Cap](https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_S.html)
* 30% [International](https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_I.html)

**Schwab Roth IRA** ^($250 per month)

* 100% Individual

**Vanguard Roth IRA** ^($500 per month)

* 100% [VTWAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vtwax)

In other words, about 15% of all retirement contributions are being invested into 4-5 individual small cap stocks.  Is that too much?  How can I tell?

For context, I am definitely comfortable with risk.  I wasn't really phased by the 50% drop in 2008 because I assumed it would come back up eventually anyway.  I was also holding STMP when it dropped by 50% in one day but didn't really ""care"" because it only caused about a 2% drop in my overall savings.  I've also done very well with singles (so far) with a 400% return on KTOS for example.

But I'm thinking maybe I just have a really shitty risk detector.  How can I tell if I'm invested too heavily into individual stocks?  What do most people recommend?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

In Namibia (my country) there is an influx of people who go and vacation for the December holidays to the coast of the country namely, Swakopmund and Walvis Bay.

Thus people need accommodation, however there are two problems or opportunities depending on how you see it: 1. If you are looking for accommodation most hotels or decent spots charge about $68/night (that's expensive for us) 2. People who own rental real estate on the coast, which is more affordable and is self- catering, poorly advertise them; horrible picture quality and non-existent marketing and additionally they don't have a website to advertise on in order to rank on google.

So i thought if could dominate the keywords "" Accommodation in Swakopmund "" or ""Accomodation in Walvis Bay"" i could advertise for people who have a spare bedroom in their house, a flat or a property to rent out and get a commission from it. However, i am a broke student and i don't have the $25 to run a wordpress business site as sad as it is. I could hunt down people who are offering this accommodation, put it on the site, write a little blog, market it and try to rank. People could book the place on my site and i send the money to the owner of the property after taking out my commission. The real estate i will advertise could go for $20 - $35 per night and if someone books  5 nights at $20/ night for example and i take my 30% commission that's $27 earned. Thus if someone is interested please message me . The baseline needed is $50 to keep the site alive for 2 months in case no revenue comes in for the time being. This is essentially all that is needed.

The bonus would be for me to go to the coast for about 14 days, go door to door offering people the chance to make money off their spare bedrooms for the holiday and take good quality pictures for the site. A bus ticket to the coast is about $21 x 2 = $42 and a place for me to crash (with internet access!) would cost about $238 in total, subtotal = $ 280. Food and transport in and around the cities \~ $90. Therefore subtotal for going the extra mile (not critical to operations) = $370. I repeat that going there is not necessary, it just helps and i get a little working holiday out of it :). First i plan to pay you back with revenue generated, then everything after break even is a 50/50 split.  Thank you Dragons.

I am interested in having a passive source of income. In the last 2/3 years,  I have lost a fair bit of money on business bets that didn't materialize or the payback has been a trickle. The first business, my brother was offered a chance to buy a business he had been in charge of for close to 5 years, it was performing alright - in a tricky economy though. I invested a fair bit of money but in a few years lost out as he ended up closing shop - citing a tough economy, and the tax debt the business inherited. I was aware of these challenges at the start, and blame myself for not keeping a closer look at operations and driving everyone towards a solid vision, albeit in a shareholder's position. A part of me feels he just lost passion in the work and didn't find a remedy.

The next business I invested in was a poultry project with a close friend. We did a lot of things right but eventually it's a tight-margins game so over time the amount invested and payback just do not make that much sense.

I invested in both these businesses with the hope the people in charge would run them without much interference from me more than financial but in both circumstances, they have really needed my input.

Now I come to my question: I am asking myself and you the reader if my investment strategy is the right one at all. My job is demanding, i'm a software engineer and I work more than 160 hrs / month. The main reason has been to build capital that launches viable businesses. Over time though, I can see the rigours of managing or having a business ""built for you"". When it's not your vision, and you are not hands on, you are often not sure why things go wrong.

I am not sure if way of investing I have been doing is sustainable or if i have picked the wrong ideas to invest in at the moment. I have the option of building my own businesses centered around apps and software that i can more easily make and manage. The lure of previous ventures has been the fact the businesses were capital intensive and in the market, there aren't many people with the funds to build infrastructure, etc. but they have not been profitable regardless.

Any thoughts, ideas and suggestion welcome.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

Realizing as in writing this that I’m not really sure how to refer to the various companies that host 401k accounts — regardless, mine is an absolute joke (John Hancock) and I’m hoping to gather some info to potentially raise hell at my company in hopes that they would consider a switch. 

Just for a bit more context; I know I was screwed when I called a customer service rep to get clarification on whether or not the funds available to me were ETFs or mutual funds and the conversation ended with me trying to explain the difference to her. John Hancock is an absolute joke. I could go on for days about it but here’s a few quickies.
- no 2fa
- limited funds
- ARCHAIC UI on the site
- can’t easily (or at all?) look at itemized contributions by date

The list goes on.....For god sake I trust second rate crypto exchanges more than them. 


Anyway, I know that 401k plans tend to be a bit of a joke in terms of assets available to invest in, etc but wondering if anybody actually likes the platform that they have. I would assume that all major brokers would support cooperate 401k plans, true? I would also assume that a Fidelity or Vanguard account would have low fee ETFs available? 

Thoughts on the topic would be much appreciated!

Edit: I guess I should clarify — the funds available in my John Hancock plan are actually pretty decent. There are a good amount of vanguard funds available that have relatively low expense ratios. My main complaint is the infrastructure of the platform. It’s antiquated at best.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing as in writing this that I’m not really sure how to refer to the various companies that host 401k accounts — regardless, mine is an absolute joke (John Hancock) and I’m hoping to gather some info to potentially raise hell at my company in hopes that they would consider a switch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for a bit more context; I know I was screwed when I called a customer service rep to get clarification on whether or not the funds available to me were ETFs or mutual funds and the conversation ended with me trying to explain the difference to her. John Hancock is an absolute joke. I could go on for days about it but here’s a few quickies.
- no 2fa
- limited funds
- ARCHAIC UI on the site
- can’t easily (or at all?) look at itemized contributions by date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on.....For god sake I trust second rate crypto exchanges more than them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I know that 401k plans tend to be a bit of a joke in terms of assets available to invest in, etc but wondering if anybody actually likes the platform that they have. I would assume that all major brokers would support cooperate 401k plans, true? I would also assume that a Fidelity or Vanguard account would have low fee ETFs available? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts on the topic would be much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

I am using DITM spy leaps to leverage 2:1. the premise is, if SPY is $300, you buy a call in 2 years at $150, and you pay $15,000 + commission + lost dividends which is equivalent to a \~4% loan.

In the ideal world, I'd have access to enough capital to cover any exercise I need to, but in the real world, I'll likely be unable to exercise an option in a downturn, as the stock I'd need to sell to exercise would be down \~80+%. So my question is, is it a real warranted concern that I may be unable to liquidate a ditm spy option every year, any year, for the proper price of the option (comparable to the IV I'd get by exercising?)

I worked through an example below...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Using 2007-2009 as an example, spy started at 147 and ended at 70.

\- My options here were for, lets say 75$ (7500). I want to roll over every year, so i'd roll over in march 2008ish before the ex-div date, for \~130.

&amp;#x200B;

\- In 2008, spy is 130. I'm not good at calculatng the value of an option, so I'm going to go with exercising as it tends to be similar. i pay 7500 to exercise, and sell for 13,000. my loss here is \~2000, as opposed to buying the 51 stocks which would be a \~870 loss.I then take that 13,000, and buy a $65 option for $6500. to do this, I needed to invest another $1000 of the capital i used to exercise. my investment is now 8500.

&amp;#x200B;

\- 2009 comes, and spy is at $70. To exercise, I need to pay another 6500.. I take the $7000, and again, I buy $35 option, which costs me an additional $3000. my investment is now $12,000

&amp;#x200B;

\- 2010 now, and spy is worth $115. My option is worth $11,500 and I paid 12000+3500 to exercise them. Now, i buy a $57.5 option (lets pretend this is a thing for my sanity), for $5750. That means I've pocketed 2250 on this trade because i made more than the option cost to exercise, so my investment is now $9750.

\- 2011 now, and it is back to 130. exercise the option for $5750. it is worth 13k. I paid 9750+5750=15,500. I sell it, and now I've finally made profit. $3250 or 33%.In summary, i invested a total of 7500$, using A LOT of capital to exercise2008: 75002009: 30002010: 35002011: 5750-------20250In that case, this strategy is stupid and using the money to buy spy straight up would be MAJORLY better than holding $20K cash,But, the idea here is NOT to exercise the options, the idea is to just sell the option and buy a new one- but should i worry about liquidity? In the case of selling the option, the only capital I needed to re-buy was:2008: 10002009: 30002010: -22502011: $3250 in profit

compared to investing the above money in spy, my return would be:

2008: 51 stocks + 8 new stocks for $1040 is 59

&amp;#x200B;

2009: 59 + 43 new stocks for 3010

&amp;#x200B;

2010: 102 - 30 stocks (2250) is 72 plus $3450 in cash

&amp;#x200B;

2011: 72 stocks sold for $9630 plus the 3450 minus the 12,800 i invested is $280 profit

&amp;#x200B;

as per my deeply flawed and incompetent math, by selling the options, I can make it through a horrific downturn and still make more money than I would buying the dip. Where am I off here? What should my cash reserves be relative to my options? the biggest cost above was in 2009, where i needed $3000, or 35% of my investment, which is a HUGE cash allocation.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My current concern is with how I&amp;#39;m leveraging spy. I am using DITM spy leaps to leverage 2:1. the premise is, if SPY is $300, you buy a call in 2 years at $150, and you pay $15,000 + commission + lost dividends which is equivalent to a ~4% loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ideal world, I&amp;#39;d have access to enough capital to cover any exercise I need to, but in the real world, I&amp;#39;ll likely be unable to exercise an option in a downturn, as the stock I&amp;#39;d need to sell to exercise would be down ~80+%. So my question is, is it a real warranted concern that I may be unable to liquidate a ditm spy option every year, any year, for the proper price of the option (comparable to the IV I&amp;#39;d get by exercising?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked through an example below...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using 2007-2009 as an example, spy started at 147 and ended at 70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My options here were for, lets say 75$ (7500). I want to roll over every year, so i&amp;#39;d roll over in march 2008ish before the ex-div date, for ~130.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- In 2008, spy is 130. I&amp;#39;m not good at calculatng the value of an option, so I&amp;#39;m going to go with exercising as it tends to be similar. i pay 7500 to exercise, and sell for 13,000. my loss here is ~2000, as opposed to buying the 51 stocks which would be a ~870 loss.I then take that 13,000, and buy a $65 option for $6500. to do this, I needed to invest another $1000 of the capital i used to exercise. my investment is now 8500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 2009 comes, and spy is at $70. To exercise, I need to pay another 6500.. I take the $7000, and again, I buy $35 option, which costs me an additional $3000. my investment is now $12,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 2010 now, and spy is worth $115. My option is worth $11,500 and I paid 12000+3500 to exercise them. Now, i buy a $57.5 option (lets pretend this is a thing for my sanity), for $5750. That means I&amp;#39;ve pocketed 2250 on this trade because i made more than the option cost to exercise, so my investment is now $9750.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 2011 now, and it is back to 130. exercise the option for $5750. it is worth 13k. I paid 9750+5750=15,500. I sell it, and now I&amp;#39;ve finally made profit. $3250 or 33%.In summary, i invested a total of 7500$, using A LOT of capital to exercise2008: 75002009: 30002010: 35002011: 5750-------20250In that case, this strategy is stupid and using the money to buy spy straight up would be MAJORLY better than holding $20K cash,But, the idea here is NOT to exercise the options, the idea is to just sell the option and buy a new one- but should i worry about liquidity?

&lt;p&gt;2008: 51 stocks + 8 new stocks for $1040 is 59&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2009: 59 + 43 new stocks for 3010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2010: 102 - 30 stocks (2250) is 72 plus $3450 in cash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011: 72 stocks sold for $9630 plus the 3450 minus the 12,800 i invested is $280 profit&lt;/p&gt;

I would like your opinion for my situation. I am a beginner investor so please bear with me. I just opened chase private client account to get the $2k sign up bonus. I currently have $300k in the account and I am not sure what to do with it. I do not need the money in the next 5 years or even 10 years since I just bought a house and car. I have 6 months savings as well. 

I was told that the US market is just too expensive now to invest and the advisor at chase said I should invest in their international fund, it is called wcm focused growth international adronly. Index msci, acwi, ex, USA, nr, usd. It is concentrated, large cap, quality growth. The YTD is 25.3% after the 1.4% management fee. Since inception it is 10%. 

I also have the option to buy mutual funds for this and the fee is 1% but I don’t save on taxes (not sure what he means by that) 

1) would you buy this fund? Managed or mutual fund? 
2) if so, how much would you invest from the $300k?
3) what would you do with the rest of the money?

I recently signed up for a CDP account in my country to hold all my future shares under my name. 

Currently I applied for a broker account with my local bank(pending approval)

All my life I always believed people made money in stocks simply by 'buy low ,sell high'. After doing some research, I come to realize that this isn't as easy as how I made it out to be in my head. 

With this in mind, I plan to invest $1k in stocks. My short term goal is to reach $5k. 

Some questions I have in mind are :

1. I want to ask is how can I reduce the brooker's fees? The brooker I am using is DBS vickers. They have a 0.28% fee($25 minimum) or IF i pay cash upfront, the buy fee is $10 but the sell fee will be 0.28% or $25 minimum.  As I am only investing $1000, the profits I expect to see for the first few trades are little and the brooker's fee will make a huge dent in it.

2. Should I do a typical buy and sell back type of thing to make small profits? But by doing so, will I incur brooker's fee for each small transaction.

3. Should I set up a CDP or custodian account? I understand the differences being that CDP the shares are under my name but frankly, I have no intention of even taking part in any votings or AGM. I just want to make money.

What advice can you guys offer a completely new beginner like me when I don't even know whats the difference between ETF and stocks.

P.S I have no prior experience in buissness or stocks for that matter. I am still a student studying aerospace engineering.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I am a complete new beginner in stock investments. &lt;/p&gt;

**Summary:**

    \*Performance:  7/10

    \*Security:           8/10

    \*Price:                 5/10

(Note: If the performance and security ranking is higher than price ranking the company is supposed to be undervalued and possibly suitable for buying.) 

**Share Price: $ 233.11 (week end 1.11.2019)**

**\[S&amp;P 500:    $ 3066.91 (week end 1.11.2019)\]**

The price of the security overreacted to the earnings report in our view.

The day before the earnings report (28.8.2019), the price closed at 330.38 and the day after the earnings report (30.8.2019), the price closed at 237.73, a 28.0% plunge in price in just 2 days.

The price has more or less remained in the territory of the drop.

The reported earnings per share and revenue came in weaker, but not enough to indicate “bad health” or to invalidate the growing trend of the company in the long run.

The company has had consistent and relatively stable growth in sales since 2011 ca. 20% annually.

It has maintained reasonable operational profit margins, which stabilized around 13% since 2014 and a strong return on investment, which grew over the last decade and stabilized around 23% in the past 5 years.

The earnings per share were growing 38% annually on average since 2011 (ca. 31% avg. since 2013 when the overall growth trend more or less stabilized and it has remained till now although annual values fluctuate (16 – 39% annually).The more recent earnings per share were also impacted by the lower effective tax rate since 2018 (was ca. 37% now ca. 24%) and contracting weighted average of shares as the company has been buying them back since 2015 (ca 2% ann. in avg.) although the number of shares was growing prior.

The P/E ratio is just bellow 20 (19.73) which means that the “company interest rate” (12 months earnings/share price) is slightly above 5% annually which is not bad in regards to low-interest rates on government bonds nowadays

The company hasn’t got any long term debts, hidden debts or preferred shares act. therefore there is no risk from financial gearing and we haven’t identified increased risk coming from excessive operational gearing (too much-fixed cost) either. Revenue fluctuates within a reasonable limit and it is unlikely this will change in foreseeable future. There is no concern regarding cash flow.

The company doesn't pay dividends but it rather significantly reinvests its money either in CAPEX (funds for acquiring, maintaining and upgrading of physical assets) and, as we have already mentioned, in stock repurchases. The CAPEX was around double the depreciation on average with little fluctuation over the last decade, which is significant level, apart from the period of the last 18 months when the CAPEX was 1.1 x depreciation. Nevertheless, the company increased stock repurchases around 60% (stock repurchase was ca 2.1 of depreciation in the last 18 months) so it could be said that the company more or less borrowed money from its usual CAPEX to finance increased stock repurchase.

The price of the company stock dropped rather significantly (ca 28%) soon after the last repurchase nevertheless even this more significant drop didn’t invalidate the overall growing trend of the share price.

**Technical Analysis**

Summary:

    \*Time to Buy:   8/10

The price of the security appears to be around the bottom of a correction pattern, which is a good spot to buy, although the technical indicators have not indicated the development of bullish trend (trend of rising price) yet.

Anyway, I have been toying around with another cash rich biotech, ADXS, which is trading for about a $10 mil market cap with over $40 mil in cash on hand and little debt.  It has decent volume of around 6 mil shares traded per day and only has a float of about 20 mil shares.

The question is, would it be possible for a small group of individuals to buy controlling shares over a period of several weeks and replace the board, issuing a one time dividend of maybe $1 per share, reserving the remaining $0.50 per share for legal and severance?   Sell any IP for some small amount as well.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sometimes invest in biotech stocks, mostly the big names like Merck, BMY, Gilead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally I stumble across some smaller nano or microcap bios that might still hold some promise.   A couple years back I bought one called Endocyte because they were trading at 1/2 of cash on hand and had a outside chance at getting through phase III.  That turned out well as they were bought out and I ended up making about 2000% profit on my shares.&lt;/p&gt;

Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI):  about 200%.

Right off the bat, it seems like if you had invested $10,000 in VTI's top 10 stock holdings rather than put that same $10,000 in VTI itself, your portfolio would likely have performed *much* better.

Does that seem generally correct? If so, why not pick a couple index funds / etfs from diversified sectors and instead of buying them, pick out a few of the top held stocks in each and invest in those instead? 

One caveat could be that you'd probably want to re-balance and adjust your portfolio's holdings somewhat regularly as the index funds you're basing them off of change theirs over time, but that doesn't seem like a big deal.

The financiers were there to meet Yasir al-Rumayyan, the state oil company’s chairman and the head of the country’s sovereign wealth fund, along with cabinet ministers and the company’s leadership.

Their message would disappoint the hosts: international investors were unwilling to buy shares in Saudi Aramco anywhere near the $2tn valuation long sought by the kingdom’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 

No amount of sweeteners — from promises of higher dividends to bonus shares for local retail investors — had 
managed to change that reality.

At the heart of Prince Mohammed’s economic reforms, the IPO was at one time seen as a mechanism to raise $100bn from a 5 per cent share sale and help open up the Saudi economy to foreign investors. Not only was the size of the listing scaled back, so was its scope, along with any plans to list on international exchanges.

Only a handful of bankers there from the nine global IPO co-ordinators were selected to deliver their recommendations: Bank of America’s Soofian Zuberi, Citigroup’s Tyler Dickson and Morgan Stanley’s Henrik Gobel. Others, such as Mike Daffey from Goldman Sachs, were left to loiter in an anteroom. The banks declined to comment.

“There were basically two options — an international deal valued at $1.5tn, which could possibly have been walked up to $1.6tn, or a local version coming in at $1.7tn,” said one person briefed on the meeting.

The bankers’ nerves were already strained after they were left waiting for five hours, occupying the time by munching on sandwiches and sipping juice with their rivals. The meeting with Saudi officials lasted just 10 minutes.

The bankers were left to head off to their respective homes, from Riyadh to Europe, without knowing what the country’s highest authorities had decided. Despite years of jumping through hurdles to win business from Prince Mohammed, the sovereign Public Investment Fund and Saudi Aramco, advisers only found out the decision on Sunday morning.

It was then that Saudi Aramco announced its 1.5 per cent sale at a price that would value its shares at $1.6tn-$1.7tn and raise only as much as $25.6bn. Plans to market the shares directly in the US, Europe and Asia were also scrapped. The IPO would be focused on Saudi and Gulf investors.

“Rumayyan must have thought: ‘Why do we want to hand over our crown jewel to these internationals [for a lower valuation] when we could sell it to our own people,’” the person said.

At an earlier valuation meeting with Mr Rumayyan several weeks before, bankers had relayed the consensus of $1.1tn-$1.5tn garnered from initial investor meetings across the US, Asia and Europe.

“Rumayyan didn’t hear anything after he heard $1.1tn,” said the person. “He went mad.”

His irritation stemmed from the rosy valuations of $2tn or more forecast by the banks when they were pitching for the mandate earlier in the year, only for them to later lower these figures after feedback from potential shareholders.

Saudi Aramco said “the IPO remains open to international investors outside the United States”.

With international banks now viewing the listing less favourably, advisers are now turning on each other. 

One accused a rival of having “whored themselves on the price range” while others spread stories of peers being castigated by Saudi officials. Another banker said: “There is real tension in the syndicate. These deals take on a dynamic and everyone turns on each other"" 

Seeing the prospect of years of work disappearing over the horizon, they are increasingly philosophical about the deal’s degeneration into, what one banker called, a “Greek tragedy”.

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3465888

&gt;Today, there are more active mutual funds and ETFs than individual stocks. Given the
increasing numbers of funds chasing a stock universe that has remained approximately
constant in recent years, it could be that the risk of crowding, and associated short-term
reversals are perhaps more likely. Using Singular Value Decompositions using all individual
stock weights of all funds—both mutual funds and ETFs—we characterize commonality
across stocks held by funds. We also characterize commonality across fund types and
construct archetypal funds. This weight matrix is sparse (with many entries that correspond
to zero weights in particular stocks for certain funds) and high dimensional with a total of
2,317 US-listed, US-focused, active equity mutual funds and ETFs and 3.406 stocks as of
December 31, 2018.


&gt;We show that despite the very large number of funds, fewer than a dozen fund
archetypes well describe the whole universe of funds. Fewer canonical fund types are
required for good approximations for mutual funds than for ETFs. The commonality of funds
has remained approximately constant since 2007 to 2018, with decreases in common ETF
positions over this time. This is consistent with the first ETF funds tending to hold similar
broad-market index benchmarks, with the newer ETFs tracking more niche indexes. Looking
at style box categorizations, we do find evidence of increased crowding over the last
decade—among growth-oriented mutual funds. We find that factor crowding, or common
factor exposures, have remained relatively constant.


&gt;The first, and most important areas of differentiation for funds is along the valuegrowth factor dimension. Not surprisingly, expense ratios matter, as do fund size. In characterizing stock portfolios held by typical mutual funds, we find the first order degree of
differentiation is along size and value, and then along small cap and volatility tilts.


&gt;***An important result is that efficient pricing can be obtained by trading funds even if
the underlying stocks were not to trade—there are enough stocks held by these funds, in the
right combinations, that results in efficient prices for the underlying stocks.*** This is only true
since 2015. Since the numbers of mutual funds have remained steady since this time, this
fact is contemporaneous with the rapid entry of new ETFs. 

Emphasis mine.  So the TLDR is the authors have found pretty compelling evidence that a lot of the fears surrounding market efficiency due to the rise of passive products may not be well founded.  And in case you're some sort of sociopath who likes this shit there's plenty of math to trudge through in the paper as well.

&lt;p&gt;We show that despite the very large number of funds, fewer than a dozen fund
archetypes well describe the whole universe of funds. Fewer canonical fund types are
required for good approximations for mutual funds than for ETFs. The commonality of funds
has remained approximately constant since 2007 to 2018, with decreases in common ETF
positions over this time. This is consistent with the first ETF funds tending to hold similar
broad-market index benchmarks, with the newer ETFs tracking more niche indexes. Looking
at style box categorizations, we do find evidence of increased crowding over the last
decade—among growth-oriented mutual funds. We find that factor crowding, or common
factor exposures, have remained relatively constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, and most important areas of differentiation for funds is along the valuegrowth factor dimension. Not surprisingly, expense ratios matter, as do fund size. In characterizing stock portfolios held by typical mutual funds, we find the first order degree of
differentiation is along size and value, and then along small cap and volatility tilts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An important result is that efficient pricing can be obtained by trading funds even if
the underlying stocks were not to trade—there are enough stocks held by these funds, in the
right combinations, that results in efficient prices for the underlying stocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This is only true
since 2015. Since the numbers of mutual funds have remained steady since this time, this
fact is contemporaneous with the rapid entry of new ETFs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emphasis mine.  So the TLDR is the authors have found pretty compelling evidence that a lot of the fears surrounding market efficiency due to the rise of passive products may not be well founded.  And in case you&amp;#39;re some sort of sociopath who likes this shit there&amp;#39;s plenty of math to trudge through in the paper as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&gt;The Federal Communications Commission announced on Monday that it will publicly auction off a valuable telecommunications asset, in a move investors viewed as a blow to U.S. satellite communications provider [Intelsat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=I).  
&gt;  
&gt;Shares of [Intelsat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=I) dropped 40% in heavy trading volume after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a tweet that his agency “must free up significant spectrum” for 5G telecommunications. The FCC told CNBC that it expects an auction to happen “before the end of 2020.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’ve concluded that the best way to advance these principles is through a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band,” Pai said. “I’m confident they’ll quickly conduct a public auction that will give everyone a fair chance to compete.”  
&gt;  
&gt;C-band spectrum is a key telecommunications wavelength the FCC regulates. Four satellite operators, including Intelsat, provide C-band services in the U.S. to about 120 million households. The FCC wants to repurpose the C-band spectrum for 5G and an auction is expected to raise tens of billions of dollars. But a public auction would see the proceeds go to the government, an option the satellite operators – organized as the C-Band Alliance – have opposed.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The fundamental issue here is that there’s the ideal and there’s the practical. Everyone recognizes the best use of this spectrum is for 5G services – but what is the most economical and timely way to do that?” Chris Quilty, president of satellite financial services firm Quilty Analytics, told CNBC. Quilty formerly led Raymond James’ coverage of sattellite communications and the broader space industry for 20 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;The C-Band Alliance [has been pushing for a private auction](https://spacenews.com/c-band-alliance-says-it-would-send-billions-to-u-s-treasury-under-private-spectrum-auction/). The group on Friday gave a proposal to the FCC where the satellite operators would keep some of the proceeds while paying taxes on the sale, as well as contributing at least $8 billion to the U.S. Treasury and possible helping fund a rural 5G network.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The private auction would generate billions in proceeds for Intelsat and the other C-band operators,” Quilty said. “The potential C-band proceeds gave Intelsat a path for deleveraging, which has otherwise escaped the company for the past 10 years.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Intelsat had a market value of about $1.8 billion before trading began on Monday. Even before the latest drop, Intelsat’s stock had declined more than 10% on three consecutive trading days as the tide shifted against the C-Band Alliance. The FCC’s announcement of a public auction means the satellite companies may not recoup the value of their C-Band investments, such as the expensive satellites.  
&gt;  
&gt;“What we’ll likely see happen, which is the worst case scenario, is that the satellite operators have every incentive to drag their heels and take this to the courts, because they’re no longer being compensated for this spectrum,” Quilty said. “People are assuming they’re still going to get something but they’re not going to get the $8 billion to $10 billion windfall they were expecting.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been following this stock in a long time and was wondering if anyone out there followed it more closely.

I am considering whether to convert these to ETFs - apparently you can do this ""in kind"" without affecting your cost basis, but you can't go backwards. Regardless, this raises a few questions about mutual funds and ETFs that I haven't understood.

1. How are mutual fund capital gains taxed? My understanding is that unlike stocks/ETFs where you have individual shares, each of which you have owned for X amount of time and each of which has appreciated independently, with a mutual fund you just have put X amount of money in at different times and as the fund grows in value your portion of the fund is proportionally larger. There are no ""shares"", so if I have contributed $10K to VTSAX a year ago, and $10K to VTSAX yesterday, and today I want to sell $10K from VTSAX, how is it determined whether I am selling the original $10K contribution, the latest $10K contribution, some amount of the gains from the original contribution, or some combination thereof?

2. I have a related question about ""liquidity"" as it pertains to ETFs. In my original example, if I have a bunch of money in VTSAX and I am retired, I can withdraw some money from the fund every year to use as income. But if I have that money in VTI instead, I have to sell a whole number of shares for income. So if I'm not contributing any more, then my portfolio is presumably growing via the price of my VTI shares increasing, but that means that I am being forced to withdraw amounts which are increasingly different from the amount I truly want to withdraw (example: if an ETF is worth $10K in price now, and I want to withdraw $31K this year, I actually need to withdraw $40K). Over time your portfolio is going up but your ability to liquidate it efficiently is going down. In the (exaggerated) limit case, you're left with only a few super expensive shares. Is this something to worry about? Does this accurately describe a disadvantage of ETFs compared to mutual funds?

Been lurking for a few months now, and the advice has been great. So its my turn to step out of the shadows.

I have investments in a range of different places. Cash, Government bonds, Funds and Shares. All the individual shares are on an investment platform, along with a few funds, but I have a fund which i manage directly with them.

Does anyone have advice for how I can monitor all my investments? 

I currently just use a really basic spreadsheet where i list the organisation, investment type, and current value of the investment. 

But it doesn't feel like a good way to do it. My wealth has decreased because I've been spending my cash, but the value of my investments have increased so i'm not totally sure how much i've spent, and how much the value of my investments have increased.

How do you monitor your investments? Are their Apps for this? or resources advising how to create a more comprehensive spreadsheet?

Now I've seen several references to contango on the topic of JO, &amp; have grown concerned that my strategy based on long-term coffee charts may be unsound if the vehicle degrades significantly over time relative to coffee spot prices. 

So does JO suffer from contango &amp; backwardation? If so, approximately how much should I add to the 0.45% expense ratio when considering how long to hold this? Does the ""smart beta"" methodology affect things?

Some of the most common answers seem to be US Treasuries, municipal bond funds, and investment grade corporate bonds, but yields are low at the moment.

**Don’t read the comments**

Most debates over financial regulation are, in an obvious first-order sense, about whether regulation should favor one group of rich powerful financial professionals, or another group. Corporate governance disputes, for instance, basically come down to whether corporate chief executive officers should have more control of their companies, or whether instead more control should go to hedge fund managers and the executives of big asset management companies. This is a problem because regulators can’t really make rules on this basis. They can’t be like “we’ve heard that some CEOs’ feelings are hurt when hedge fund managers criticize their multimillion-dollar paychecks, so we’re changing the rules to be nicer to the CEOs.”


They don’t have to, though, because this is only true in an obvious first-order sense. In fact the CEOs and the hedge fund managers are just representatives of broader groups and more important principles. The hedge fund managers will tell you that they invest the pension money of ordinary people, and that anyway they are advocating for more power for ordinary investors. The CEOs will tell you that they just want to be able to make long-term decisions for the good of their companies in a way that will preserve ordinary people’s jobs and savings. And then if the regulators make a rule favoring the CEOs they can talk about the ordinary workers they’re protecting, and if they make a rule favoring the hedge fund managers they can talk about the ordinary investors they’re protecting, and it is all much more palatable than if you just talk about the CEOs and the hedge fund managers, and also it is basically true. It’s not like the CEOs and the hedge fund managers are fighting each other in a closed ecosystem; the balance of power between them does matter, in an indirect but real way, for everyone else.


It can all feel pretty abstract, though. It’s all well and good to say that you’re representing ordinary people, but it’s better to show it. Ideally what you want is for some ordinary people to write letters to the regulators saying “actually you should favor corporate CEOs over hedge fund managers because of my retirement savings,” or whatever. It can be hard to find ordinary people who actually think that, though, or who have paid enough attention to the issue to write those letters; it feels pretty abstract to them too!


So the next-best choice is to imagine what ordinary people would say if they actually supported your side, and then write that down. Write an imaginary letter on behalf of an imaginary ordinary person, urging the regulator to take the side that favors CEOs or hedge fund managers, whichever side you’re on.
And then once you’ve written that letter just find a real ordinary person and ask her to sign it, whatever, who cares, it’s just a letter, who is going to check.


Bloomberg’s Zachary Mider and Ben Elgin checked:

&gt;When Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton handed a policy win to corporate executives this month, he pointed to a surprising source of support: a mailbag full of encouragement from ordinary Americans.
&gt;To hear Clayton tell it, these folks are really focused on the intricacies of the corporate shareholder-voting process. “Some of the letters that struck me the most,” he said at a commission meeting in Washington, “came from long-term Main Street investors, including an Army veteran and a Marine veteran, a police officer, a retired teacher, a public servant, a single mom, a couple of retirees who saved for retirement.” Each bolstered Clayton’s case for limiting the power of dissenting shareholders.
But a close look at the seven letters Clayton highlighted, and about two dozen others submitted to the SEC by supposedly regular people, shows they are the product of a misleading -- and laughably clumsy -- public relations campaign by corporate interests.
That retired teacher? Pauline Yee said she never wrote a letter, although the signature was hers. … “I never wrote a letter,” said one of the retirees, Vytautas Alksninis, reached by phone at his home in Connecticut. “What’s this all about?”
&gt;Then there’s the public servant Clayton mentioned. … She said the letter originated with a public-affairs firm that contacted her out of the blue.
“They wrote it, and I allowed them to use my name after I read it,” she said. “I didn’t go digging into all of this.”

What is particularly bad here is that “at least 20” of the fake letters contain “an out-of-context phrase inserted into the SEC’s mailing address”: If you’re writing a letter to the SEC, you put the SEC’s address at the top just for old time’s sake (of course you don’t mail it, you just submit it online), and for some reason the person mass-writing these letters inserted the phrase “A Coalition of Growth Companies” into the address that he or she cut and pasted into all the fake letters. Oops!
The specific debate here is about the regulation of proxy advisers; we have talked about it a couple of times before. Basically there are companies called proxy advisers that tell investment managers how to vote on corporate matters, and sometimes they tell the investment managers to vote against corporate management, and the managers don’t like that so they’ve asked the SEC to regulate the advisers more. They can’t just come out and say that, so instead the argument is that the proxy advisers, and the big investment funds who rely on them, might have political and social and governance and power agendas that conflict with the interests of the individual humans whose retirement savings are invested in those funds—that people’s savings are “being steered by third parties to promote individual agendas, rather than to further their primary goals of being able to have enough money,” as Clayton said in the next sentence of his statement.


You can just say that, and people do, and it has a certain truth to it; there are real conflicts between the interests of investment managers (and proxy advisers) and those of their ultimate investors. But it’s better if you can find an 83-year-old Army veteran to say “how disgusted I am that my financial investments are being used as a political pawn,” or a retired Marine veteran” to say “I didn’t invest my money to have others make any kind of political statement. I invested my money to be able to leave something for my children and grandchildren in order to make their lives a little better,” or a hard-working single mother to say “Let the folks who work at proxy advisory firms bring about social change on their dime, not mine,” or a retiree to say “Call me naïve but I certainly didn’t sign up for groups with their own agenda voting my proxy!”


Obviously you can’t find people to say that, because no normal human actually pays attention to or cares about any of this. But if you work on one side of the issue, you can convince yourself that normal people should care about it, and then you can imagine what they might say if they did care, and then you can write it down, and then as a final, only-somewhat-fraudulent step, you can go find an ordinary person to sign the letter you wrote. Perhaps you can even give them a brief summary of the issue, and let them read the letter they’re signing, and get them to care about it enough to agree with you for five minutes before they forget all about it.


The thing is the letters are fine! Whoever wrote them mostly did a good job of imagining how an SEC chairman, or a financial columnist for that matter, would imagine how an 83-year-old Army veteran would think about proxy advisers if he bothered to think about proxy advisers. As works of fiction they have a certain verisimilitude.


Of course it is gross to find out that they are fictional, and that the SEC is citing the support of “Main Street investors” who do not actually support the regulation, but you should not kid yourself that it matters. The SEC isn’t changing the rules because it believes that that’s what Main Street investors want; it’s changing the rules because it believes that that’s what Main Street investors would want, if they paid attention to any of this. The SEC, and the people actually writing the letters, agree that this change is in the interests of ordinary investors and is the sort of thing that ordinary investors would want. It just feels more concrete if they can point to a ordinary investor who does want it.
The obvious solution here is to explicitly allow fictional comment letters. Of course the SEC already allows fictional comment letters, in the sense that it doesn’t seem to do any identity checking, and we have talked before about how lots of comment letters are blatantly fictitious. Many fictitious comment letters seem to be submitted for the sake of numbers: It is nice to say “a hundred ordinary investors wrote in to support this,” or whatever, but that’s rarely true and should not be taken seriously. But other fictitious letters are like these letters; they are submitted for the sake of their argument, and for a certain ordinary-investor flavor that comes from a talented writer of fiction trying to channel what he thinks an ordinary investor would actually feel and say. Why not let those fiction writers practice openly? Why not submit a letter from like the Coalition of Giant Company CEOs saying “as CEOs, we like this rule, but we also think it’s in the interests of ordinary investors, and to give you a sense of that here’s what we imagine an 83-year-old Army veteran might hypothetically have to say about it.” And then you write the fake letter, and the SEC can say “we too can easily imagine that an elderly veteran might say ‘how disgusted I am that my financial investments are being used as a political pawn,’” etc. etc. etc., it loses almost none of its rhetorical effect for being fake. Just admit that it’s all fake!

Say SPY is $310, and I sell a put option expiring 3 months from now at $300. If SPY stays above $300, great, I collect the premium (approx 4.8) and repeat the process.

&lt;p&gt;My thought process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say SPY is $310, and I sell a put option expiring 3 months from now at $300. If SPY stays above $300, great, I collect the premium (approx 4.8) and repeat the process.

&gt; IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS pretty powerful: China Nuclear Engineering Construction Group. Once controlled by the People’s Liberation Army, it is now, it says, part of a “central state-owned enterprise (SOE)”, an elite class of firms belonging to the Chinese government. Its website is full of pictures of its executives signing deals around the country. Like any good state-run giant, it is politically correct, its statements echoing Communist Party slogans. There is just one snag: China Nuclear Engineering Construction Group is not a central SOE.

&gt; As China’s economy slows, defaults have risen sharply. Such failures, though painful, separate strong companies from also-rans, a process other countries know well. In China there is an extra wrinkle: the downturn is also exposing fake SOEs. These are companies that misled creditors about their state connections to suggest they would be supported if they ran into trouble. But when trouble arises, the government is nowhere to be found.

&gt; Last month Huarong, a firm that handles non-performing loans, put 610m yuan ($87m) of China Nuclear Engineering Construction’s assets up for sale, consisting of property in the province of Anhui. Despite its name, China Nuclear focused on property, like several other fake SOEs. It also benefited from confusion with a real SOE, China Nuclear Engineering and Construction Corporation (eagle-eyed readers will spot two differences in their names).

&gt; It has plenty of peers. China Huayang Economic and Trade Group claimed to be one of China’s first SOEs, but a subsidiary said in a recent filing that it is in fact a non-state entity. Huayang has defaulted on 7bn yuan in bonds. China City Construction sold 99% of its shares in 2016 to a private investor, but kept calling itself an SOE. It has since had a string of defaults. Other firms have embellished their connections. China Energy Reserve and Chemicals Group Overseas Capital Company reassured rating agencies with its structure, supposedly traceable to a powerful SOE. It defaulted on a $350m bond last year.

&gt; Such stories have become common enough that Gelonghui, a financial-information company, published a tongue-in-cheek guide on how to become a fake SOE. Find a long-forgotten government institution; target an official with no hope of promotion; then “be a shameless toady” to get the institution’s seal to register your company. Finally, build a maze of subsidiaries.

&gt; **Fake SOEs are only a small part of China’s economic landscape. But they highlight two pathologies. First, private firms struggle to get financing. Banks are more willing to lend to (real) SOEs, knowing that they are less likely to go bust.**

&gt; The second is poor due diligence. **The belief that the government will prop up SOEs is a substitute for assessing their true value. Chinese investors are not the only ones who fall prey to this. When China Energy Reserve defaulted, South Korean brokerages made large losses. Barclays, a British bank, was one of its underwriters.**

&gt; Red flags are often obvious. A recent visit to the registered address of the state firm listed as the owner of China Nuclear revealed another, apparently unrelated company. “Ultimately the problem is that investors aren’t sufficiently rational,” says Zhang Licong of CITIC Securities. “They have their natural biases, and some firms take full advantage of them.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/11/14/some-chinese-firms-turn-out-to-have-lied-about-their-state-pedigree""&gt;https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/11/14/some-chinese-firms-turn-out-to-have-lied-about-their-state-pedigree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So it is paying them—sometimes in amounts approaching a half-million dollars.

The company is offering sign-on bonuses to some businesses that don’t take its cards in a bid to catch up to rivals Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. The payments range from under $10,000 to about $450,000.

Known more for its focus on upscale customers than its mass-market appeal, AmEx has long lagged behind Visa and Mastercard in the race for American businesses. In 2018, Visa and Mastercard were accepted in some 1.3 million more U.S. locations than AmEx, which had 10.3 million locations, according to the Nilson Report. Investors have pressed the company to catch up.

In 2016, AmEx said it would close the gap by the end of this year. Since then, annual dollar targets for its internal salespeople signing up new merchants have increased at a double-digit pace, according to current and former employees. In some cases, the salespeople are dangling hefty payments with few, if any, conditions and discounted swipe fees—the toll merchants pay for each card payment—to even tiny businesses.

AmEx Chief Executive Stephen Squeri has said the company is on track to meet its goal, but the payments show it hasn’t been an easy sell. Sign-on bonuses with no strings attached are nearly unheard of in the credit-card business. Visa and Mastercard sometimes pay businesses to start accepting cards, but that money is meant to defray the cost of payment technology upgrades. Discover Financial Services also sometimes reimburses businesses.

Anré Williams, head of AmEx’s global merchant and network services, said the company has offered bonuses to a small number of businesses, including some that had previously refused to accept AmEx. The sign-on incentives were intended to offset technical and marketing costs, he said.

AmEx said it has added more than three million business locations since 2017, mostly through the third-party payment processors that participate in its OptBlue program. The company said its internal salespeople gave sign-on bonuses to around 133 businesses since 2018.

AmEx “made a business decision to provide targeted sign-on incentives to strategic, priority holdout merchants, which comprise a tiny fraction of a percent of the merchants we acquire in a year,” said Mr. Williams.

For nearly 20 years, Exxcel Gymnastics and Climbing didn’t accept AmEx because of its higher swipe fees, said co-owner Tatiana Kamarskaya.

Last year, an AmEx representative visited the children’s gym in Newton, Mass., with an offer that was too good to pass up: a $15,000 sign-on bonus, no minimum charge volume required, and a pledge to match Visa and Mastercard on fees.

“I said ‘wow they really want our business’,” said Ms. Kamarskaya.

Merchant acceptance fuels both sides of AmEx’s card business. Unlike Visa and Mastercard, AmEx both issues its own cards and operates the network on which they run.

While the merchant gap has vexed AmEx executives for decades, the company had a fallback in the form of higher fees. The company for years distanced itself from rivals by courting well-heeled consumers. Businesses agreed to its higher swipe fees on the premise that AmEx cardholders would spend more.

Everything changed when big banks on the Visa and Mastercard networks began rolling out generous rewards cards with free flights and hotel stays. Some of AmEx’s biggest spenders began using other cards.

At its 2016 investor day, AmEx pledged to close the gap by 2019. “Over time, a larger merchant base will translate into higher billings, improved perception of coverage and greater scale and relevance,” said then-CEO Kenneth Chenault.

To meet the goal, AmEx’s salespeople were given “parity lists” of businesses that weren’t accepting AmEx cards, according to people familiar with the matter. Commissions were tied to purchase-volume targets for new businesses that salespeople mostly found on their own. Exceed that target, earn a bonus. Merchants on the parity lists—which included small businesses—came with an additional payout of several thousand dollars, the people said.

The lists were unpopular. Top salespeople were hesitant to spend time courting small companies with low charge volume, the people said. In 2018, AmEx changed its salespeople’s bonuses to tie them even closer to the parity lists. On a call to discuss the changes, a former vice president in the division told unhappy salespeople they were welcome to find new jobs, the people said. Bonuses were tweaked again earlier this year to prioritize the merchants on the lists.

Meanwhile, the company has sweetened the financial incentives for businesses.

Last year, AmEx cleared salespeople to pay bonuses of up to $10,000 without manager approval to businesses it expects to generate less than $3 million in annual AmEx charges. “We realize we are getting into the tougher holdouts and we want you to have every tool at your disposal to try to close these out,” the former vice president wrote in an email to salespeople reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

That figure was later bumped to $20,000, regardless of the merchant’s size, according to an internal document reviewed by the Journal. A regional vice president could approve sign-on bonuses of up to $100,000, it added.

In some cases, AmEx has paid much more. A small number of big merchants have received payments of around $450,000 since last year, according to people familiar with the matter. It also has offered to waive the swipe fees for a small number of businesses for six months, according to an internal document titled “Parity Push Project.”

Mr. Williams said AmEx considers a number of factors beyond merchant size, including proximity to businesses whose employees use AmEx corporate cards. “This could be a parking garage near a company’s regional headquarters or a small business,” he said.

For years, Ralph Carlo was a holdout. He repeatedly declined to take AmEx at his New Haven, Conn., heating-oil business because of its higher fees.

In spring 2018, an AmEx salesperson offered Mr. Carlo a $2,500 sign-on bonus. He still wasn’t convinced. The salesperson returned with his boss, a $5,000 bonus and a pledge to lower the swipe fee. Mr. Carlo said the lower fee changed his mind; the bonus was upped to $7,500, anyway.

“It surprised me that he raised it because I wasn’t asking for it,” he said.

Mr. Carlo’s Tracey Energy Services did around $43,000 in AmEx sales in the second half of 2018, he said. At that pace, it would take about six years for AmEx to recoup the $7,500 bonus.

I’m a real estate agent (started six months ago), still live with my parents, earning about $750 per month (I live in Namibia and have simplified the currency conversion to more easily explain my point). It’s a recession and I’m paid solely on commissions. Thus, I make anywhere between $300 and $3000 on a given month. I save a third of my income and recently saved enough to buy a Roulette Machine which I placed in my uncles bar - this makes about $1000 per month, of which I save 100% in order to buy another machine in October 2020.

The country is in a recession (after a 35 year bull run) and I just saw a bank circular which had a table stating: “3 Month Treasury Bills - 7%”. I don’t understand what this means. Treasury bills, to my understanding, are bought at a discount of the face value.  Does this mean 1 TB (they can only be bought in multiples of $1000) will cost me $930 and after three months I will receive $1000? Seems almost too good to be true.

If my understanding is correct, surely it would be worthwhile to use the Roulette Machine income to purchase one 3-month TB every month and by the third month have a stream of ‘interest’  from maturing TBs which can be used to reduce the next TB purchase?  

Eg

A 3 month TB bought in January costs me $930.  It matures and I receive $1000 in March. I then reinvest $930 to buy another TB, and add $860 from my pocket plus $70 from Januaries matured TB to buy an additional one. 

Thus, over-time, exponentially reducing the ‘out-of-pocket’ cost of purchasing additional TBs. 

Of course my understanding of what a Treasury Bill (or my interpretation of the table in the circular) could be wrong and I just went on a fanciful tangent for the amusement of experienced investors. 😂🥺

&lt;p&gt;I’m a real estate agent (started six months ago), still live with my parents, earning about $750 per month (I live in Namibia and have simplified the currency conversion to more easily explain my point). It’s a recession and I’m paid solely on commissions. Thus, I make anywhere between $300 and $3000 on a given month. I save a third of my income and recently saved enough to buy a Roulette Machine which I placed in my uncles bar - this makes about $1000 per month, of which I save 100% in order to buy another machine in October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country is in a recession (after a 35 year bull run) and I just saw a bank circular which had a table stating: “3 Month Treasury Bills - 7%”. I don’t understand what this means. Treasury bills, to my understanding, are bought at a discount of the face value.  Does this mean 1 TB (they can only be bought in multiples of $1000) will cost me $930 and after three months I will receive $1000? Seems almost too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my understanding is correct, surely it would be worthwhile to use the Roulette Machine income to purchase one 3-month TB every month and by the third month have a stream of ‘interest’  from maturing TBs which can be used to reduce the next TB purchase?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 3 month TB bought in January costs me $930.  It matures and I receive $1000 in March. I then reinvest $930 to buy another TB, and add $860 from my pocket plus $70 from Januaries matured TB to buy an additional one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, over-time, exponentially reducing the ‘out-of-pocket’ cost of purchasing additional TBs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course my understanding of what a Treasury Bill (or my interpretation of the table in the circular) could be wrong and I just went on a fanciful tangent for the amusement of experienced investors. 😂🥺&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

I don't quite understand the skepticism myself, given the nominal growth rate of the S&amp;P 500 since 2007 and the OP's disciplined approach to reducing expenses and putting every spare penny into his investment, but just to make sure I wasn't kidding myself, here's [a Monte Carlo sim](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation?s=y&amp;fullHistory=true&amp;adjustmentType=1&amp;smoothingRate=75&amp;historicalVolatility=true&amp;volatility=12.0&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;endYear=2018&amp;years=12&amp;frequency=2&amp;mode=2&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;inflationVolatility=3.0&amp;sequenceStressTest=2&amp;inflationMean=4.0&amp;startYear=2007&amp;bootstrapModel=1&amp;inflationModel=1&amp;customIntervals=false&amp;adjustmentPercentage=4.0&amp;dof=30&amp;adjustmentAmount=2500&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;circularBootstrap=true&amp;simulationModel=1&amp;distribution=1&amp;currentAge=70&amp;bootstrapMaxYears=20&amp;historicalCorrelations=true&amp;returnList=0%2C+2.5%2C+5%2C+7.5%2C+10%2C+12.5&amp;lifeExpectancyModel=0&amp;bootstrapMinYears=1&amp;meanReturn=7.0&amp;percentileList=10%2C+25%2C+50%2C+75%2C+90&amp;rollingAveragePeriods=3&amp;initialAmount=1000) I set up with similar parameters to that thread. I can't make it identical -- for one thing, I don't know all the details of OP's investment history -- but using some reasonable assumptions based on what was written, here's what I come up with.

**50th percentile outcome: $1,004,384 (nominal)**

Ignore the ""5 years"" that the UI shows. I had to hack the URL for the sim to get it to do exactly 12 years. You can inspect the hack yourself by examining the [URL](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation?s=y&amp;fullHistory=true&amp;adjustmentType=1&amp;smoothingRate=75&amp;historicalVolatility=true&amp;volatility=12.0&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;endYear=2018&amp;years=12&amp;frequency=2&amp;mode=2&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;inflationVolatility=3.0&amp;sequenceStressTest=2&amp;inflationMean=4.0&amp;startYear=2007&amp;bootstrapModel=1&amp;inflationModel=1&amp;customIntervals=false&amp;adjustmentPercentage=4.0&amp;dof=30&amp;adjustmentAmount=2500&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;circularBootstrap=true&amp;simulationModel=1&amp;distribution=1&amp;currentAge=70&amp;bootstrapMaxYears=20&amp;historicalCorrelations=true&amp;returnList=0%2C+2.5%2C+5%2C+7.5%2C+10%2C+12.5&amp;lifeExpectancyModel=0&amp;bootstrapMinYears=1&amp;meanReturn=7.0&amp;percentileList=10%2C+25%2C+50%2C+75%2C+90&amp;rollingAveragePeriods=3&amp;initialAmount=1000).

Assumptions:

* 12 years

* Use historical data starting from 2007 (full data available only through 2018)

* Average of $2500/month contribution to SPY

* First two years forced to be the worst years, to simulate the GFC of 2008

Even if I [remove the 2007 starting date and let the sim pull from the full history of SPY data](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation?s=y&amp;fullHistory=true&amp;adjustmentType=1&amp;smoothingRate=75&amp;historicalVolatility=true&amp;volatility=12.0&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;endYear=2018&amp;years=12&amp;frequency=2&amp;mode=2&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;inflationVolatility=3.0&amp;sequenceStressTest=2&amp;inflationMean=4.0&amp;startYear=1972&amp;bootstrapModel=1&amp;inflationModel=1&amp;customIntervals=false&amp;adjustmentPercentage=4.0&amp;dof=30&amp;adjustmentAmount=2500&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;circularBootstrap=true&amp;simulationModel=1&amp;distribution=1&amp;currentAge=70&amp;bootstrapMaxYears=20&amp;historicalCorrelations=true&amp;returnList=0%2C+2.5%2C+5%2C+7.5%2C+10%2C+12.5&amp;lifeExpectancyModel=0&amp;bootstrapMinYears=1&amp;meanReturn=7.0&amp;percentileList=10%2C+25%2C+50%2C+75%2C+90&amp;rollingAveragePeriods=3&amp;initialAmount=1000), the 50% percentile outcome is still in the ballpark: $995,998.

This is to say nothing of the top half of outcomes that are well above $1MM. For the lower half, the 10th percentile case was in the region of $646K, which is still a nice chunk of change.

Especially of those who are experienced with this sort of thing. I'd really appreciate it.

Recently my grandparents passed away and left their five children a pretty nice inheritance, which they divided amongst themselves. That involved two houses, which they sold, and some cash.

Now for my parents who are in their early sixties, that was more money than they've ever seen in their lives suddenly deposited in their bank accounts. For many it's probably not that much, but for them and us, the children who never expected any inheritance of our own and worried about having to carry them in old age, it's a lot. We grew up pretty poor and that put a strain on our family. My dad has pretty much always been unemployed and my mom was an on and off cleaning lady. They lived on wellfare most of their lives.

So after getting the inheritance they splurged a bit, which was to be expected and I'm happy for them. I gave them a bit of financial advice but didn't want to be too meddlesome since it is their money. But the splurging seems to be continueing to the point where us siblings are getting a bit worried (my dad bought three motorbikes, sold one at a loss already, and now they're thinking about buying a garagebox and a van just to store them ... that sort of thing) and now we're trying to give them some financial advice to get them to invest some of it. Mostly because we're still worried we'll have to carry them financially in old age since they didn't build anything up for themselves. And we all have our own financial worries to deal with. Although I think the fact that our parents are financially illiterate and we grew up poor did lead us to educate ourselves better on the subject.



Anyway I was thinking it would be a good idea to get them into real-estate. (and a portion into something like Vanguard) And looking for some arrangement that might be mutually beneficial, beyond guaranteeing some inheritance still remaninig down the road.

So right now I'm renting and spend around 700 euro's a month on rent. (and did quite a lot of home improvements over the years) Money going into the pocket of my landlord. And they love me for it :D But I was thinking I could suggest my parents take out a bank loan (if they can't or won't buy straight up), buy an appartment or a house or perhaps even an appartment building, and I would pay rent to them while they also pay monthly to pay off the bank loan faster. The way I see it I could pay a lower rent than I do now which would allow me to save a bit more, and at the same time I would be helping them avoid high loan costs and paying off the property faster would solidify inheritance or allow them to perhaps sell it for a profit later. Or for me to buy it from them at a better deal than I'd get from a bank, and a profit for my parents too, preferably.

I'm looking for as many mutually beneficial arguments as I can find. And perhaps also the con's. And I also need to know if for me it's also more interesting than just taking out a bank loan myself and buying a place and paying that off, all on my own.

Some of the benefits I can think of:

- Once it's paid off, they own the property to then do with as they please (unless we come to some prior understanding)
- I get to pay a slightly lower monthly rent
- We guarantee they don't waste all their inheritance, and if nothing else, selling the property later on could cover elderly care costs
- I could perhaps later buy the property from them directly at a more interesting rate than a bank, at which point they have they money back and probably some agreed upon extra (I guess we could agree I pay at least a certain duration of rent or something, if owning the property in itself isn't interesting enough?)
- They are more diversified and less worried about inflation/recession, which is something they often talk about
- In case of an appartment building, I could manage it for them. Which again could be mutually beneficial. And they could then gain additional income from other tenants.

I would personally hold stocks but I would pretty much sell if there's some crazy increase within a short period of time.

I also own my own IT Consulting and System Engineering company that builds and sells IT Hardware Solutions.

Thing is, I fucking hate sales and cold calling people and because of that its keeping me from growing the business. 

I have about $100k cash sitting in my business checking and I'm trying to understand what else I can do. My wife and I own everything cash already with no debt. I could probably come up with another $100k in the next year to invest as well.   


I'm not so much looking for passive income. I would like to quite my day job and stop messing with I.T i f possible. Nothing about it makes me happy, though I am pretty decent at it, its not what i want to do. 

I'm tired of being stuck at the $100k-$200k mark and want to make bigger moves. I'm only 27 but time is flying and being already married with 2 kids... well lets say I'm not getting any younger. 

What are some things I can look into to create a new full time income using money to make money?

Should I open one that I can use in Canada or the US since like I said I’m planning to move their. Currently my bank is CIBC but would It be worth opening a investement account somewhere else?

I actually did not thing anyone would respond to this but a lot of people did. Some asked for proof. Here it is.  Omitting real estate holdings.

Also including credit report - no debt outside a used car loan because I will not pay cash when I get money at 3.49%.

Edit 2

People asked for more details.

At a high level I have been investing / studying markets since I was very young. I tried everything (internet stocks, FOREX, Options, Futures, small caps etc) coupled with fundamental and technical analysis.  Did OK, even won second place in a trading contest but never got what I wanted.

Like many people I made bad decisions and had divorce, job loss, etc.  Even had to close out an IRA in my twenties.

Ended up turning to a disciplined index fund strategy about 12 years ago. 

Strategy was to max out 401k and live below my means (old car, no cable tv, make my own food, etc).  At the end of each month swept all my pennies into an after tax fund since my 401k was maxed.  That is it.  Make your own coffee and buy VOO or SPY ideally in a tax advantaged account.

I road this through the 2008/2009 crash - kept my investments and bought more.

I also have small (like 5% of my money) in Bitcoin, Tesla and Pot stocks.  This is purely for fun.  

A couple people mentioned this was just luck.  I think it is important to understand the market will move up, retrace, consolidate and then move higher.  The timing of this is somewhat luck.  The strategy part is live below your means, buy and accumulate positions for years so when a bull market hits you are in.  I guess you can call each runup ""luck"" except people keep living in debt no matter what their income.  I would much prefer people take away an investment strategy that does work if you are a disciplined from someone not born rich and who tried a lot of different strategies.

The takeaway really is with education and discipline you can reach a level of financial independence even after many screwups.  I can publish this simple system and honestly few will follow it...  There are no ads, systems to buy or affiliate links. I make zero dollars sharing this.  I make my own coffee and watch netflix.  I invest the rest in index funds.  Take a trip or buy something if it really is important to me.  That is it.

People asked what is next.  Teach my six year old and newborn savings and investing. Opening a ROTH* for the 6 year old and custodial brokerage account for the new addition.  They will have millions as a safety net at retirement.  They will now know about this money and will need to find their own path in life.

Staying in the market, if it crashes I will buy more.

Stating in until I reach 5-10 million.  Don't need the money for a long time...

* A ROTH requires earned income, they need to be hired in a family business, mow the lawn, model, deliver papers, etc. Google and your accountant has more legal ways to do this and interesting discussion.

Did OK, even won second place in a trading contest but never got what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many people I made bad decisions and had divorce, job loss, etc.  Even had to close out an IRA in my twenties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ended up turning to a disciplined index fund strategy about 12 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy was to max out 401k and live below my means (old car, no cable tv, make my own food, etc).  At the end of each month swept all my pennies into an after tax fund since my 401k was maxed.  That is it.  Make your own coffee and buy VOO or SPY ideally in a tax advantaged account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I road this through the 2008/2009 crash - kept my investments and bought more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have small (like 5% of my money) in Bitcoin, Tesla and Pot stocks.  This is purely for fun.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple people mentioned this was just luck.  I think it is important to understand the market will move up, retrace, consolidate and then move higher.  The timing of this is somewhat luck.  The strategy part is live below your means, buy and accumulate positions for years so when a bull market hits you are in.  I guess you can call each runup &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; except people keep living in debt no matter what their income.  I would much prefer people take away an investment strategy that does work if you are a disciplined from someone not born rich and who tried a lot of different strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The takeaway really is with education and discipline you can reach a level of financial independence even after many screwups.  I can publish this simple system and honestly few will follow it...  There are no ads, systems to buy or affiliate links. I make zero dollars sharing this.  I make my own coffee and watch netflix.  I invest the rest in index funds.  Take a trip or buy something if it really is important to me.  That is it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People asked what is next.  Teach my six year old and newborn savings and investing. Opening a ROTH* for the 6 year old and custodial brokerage account for the new addition.  They will have millions as a safety net at retirement.  They will now know about this money and will need to find their own path in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying in the market, if it crashes I will buy more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stating in until I reach 5-10 million.  Don&amp;#39;t need the money for a long time...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A ROTH requires earned income, they need to be hired in a family business, mow the lawn, model, deliver papers, etc. Google and your accountant has more legal ways to do this and interesting discussion.  You can google &amp;quot;roth ira for newborn&amp;quot;.  I did not point this out early on. Sorry.&lt;/li&gt;

We need your advice!  Let me describe our situation:

1. We’re a couple in our middle 40s with two children living in a low-living-cost midwestern university town. 

2. We both have stable/secured jobs and plan to work until we are 65 (or at least 60). We have maximized all our tax-deferred accounts, including 401A, 403B, 457, Roth IRA and HSA, total $90K per year. Also, we have no debt (no mortgage, etc). 

3. We NOW have $300K CASH sitting in the savings account with an interest rate of 1.9%. We didn’t invest in stocks after the 2008 crash (except for our 401K), we put every saved $ into the savings account with nearly negligible interest. Now we realize it is a HUGE mistake.

4. We don’t foresee any huge expenses in coming years except college tuition. Kid #1 will go to college in 4 years, and we should be able to save another $100K within 4 years for her. Kid #2 will go to college in 12 years, so we have plenty of time to save money for her college. BTW, we didn't invest in 529.

5. So, the million-dollar-question is what should we do with the $300K CASH? Wife thinks we should buy stocks in a lump sum way or over a period of time such as over 2-3 years (don’t know which one would be better), given we have at least 20 years before retirement. Wife believes time in market is more important than timing the market. Husband thinks we should let the cash sit in our savings account and wait for 1-2 years, since stock market is at its record high. Husband believes there is a good chance that market will crash in 1-2 years. 

6. Who would you support? Wife or Husband? Or if you were us, what would you do?

If you researched the company,

The risks are really minimal compared to the current price. There reason why the stock has been falling for the past years is because of a minority shareholder revolt, increased costs, a 2 year delay and sovereign risk.

Minority shareholders who bought at a much higher price are scared as shit that Rio Tinto will take over the company for a market price slightly  above the current one (maybe around the EV of $2.3B) and so they sold/lowered their positions significantly to not get fucked over. I think that that is not a risk for a buyer at this price.

There's also the project delay and cost blowout, for that they will delay the start of underground production (projected FCF of $1B/year) to 2023( but i think more likely 2024). They already have the ability to get more debt to cover the capex needed, possibly up to $3B more and the interest payments are covered by the current cash flow from the open pit operations).

There's so much talk of a really bad recession I can't help but feel worried. Am I wasting my time? Should I keep it simple with index funds?

I'm an investor on LendingClub for the interest earning notes they offer which are peer 2 peer loans. They have their own credit rating metric and provide additional data for each of the notes such as gross income, occupation, credit score, revolving credit balance, application type, no of credit lines and so on. The notes are structured as an amortizing loan where the borrowers pay a fixed payment amount each month that is composed of principal and interest such that the entire principal amount is also paid off at the end of term length, like a mortgage.

In addition to what ratios are available, i thought it would be prudent to have additional independent ways to check these notes so i set up a calculator on excel that computes a total obligation to post-tax discretionary income ratio to make a risk assessment similar what is done with the debt/EBITDA or debt/capitalization ratio. I used the following assumptions which i was hoping i could get your thoughts or a sanity check on:

\-Total obligation is computed as (total monthly payment + Monthly revolving credit balance) \* term length of note-Discretionary net income is computed as (total gross income over the note term length) \*(1-(federal tax rate +state tax rate) )\* 40%(40% in the above formula reflects the assumption that 60% of post-tax income goes towards 'Necessary Expenses' such as rent, food, utilities etc)

The main doubts i have is:

1. Does it make sense to include the revolving credit balance in computing a total obligation amount?My thoughts were that, hypothetically, if you were required to pay down all your obligation tomorrow, then in evaluating one's ability to pay the note would factor in the revolving credit balance so i thought it makes sense to include in the leverage ratio calculation.
2. The 60% assumption for necessary expenses in computing the discretionary net income has a weak basis in the 50-30-20 ratio a lot of personal finance websites discuss for the appropriate split between necessaries-fun-savings, and then tweaking it a bit. What do people think about this?

hey guys, whenever im doing an initial company analysis, obviously one of my questions is how much market share it currently has. This information seems to be hard to come by, and I always end up on fucking quora, which is absolutely useless.

is there a specific website you guys use to monitor certain industries and company’s respective market share?

Age - 16

Employment - I have had a job since I was 9, and have saved all my money roughly £18,000, but now it is time for me to leave my job and focus on school full time as I am starting to fall behind due to my job. Because of this I will no longer have an income where as I currently get £680 a month. This is why I am turning to investing. 

Where I live - U.K

Capital - This is a little bit confusing, but I have roughly £4,000 in an ISA I can access when I’m 18, I have roughly £12,000 accessible right now, as well as a monthly saver with about £750, I also have a separate account called a help to buy ISA for when I get a house with £1600.

TL;DR - 
Current Account - £12,000
Monthly Saver - £750
Help to buy ISA - £1600
18 Year old ISA - £4000 

Expenses - Because I am only 16 I do not have a car and still live with my parents although I am eager to get a car when I am 17 ( in May ) and a house as soon as I can. Currently the only expenses I have is £9 a month for Netflix, and £250 a month standing order and another £200 a month standing order, into my monthly saver and help to buy isa respectively. 

TL;DR - 
£459 a month

Objectives and Time Frame - The closest horizon I am saving up for is my first car this coming May, and will roughly cost £13000 including insurance. I would also like to make enough money to not only be able to run and use the car but still be able to save into my help to buy ISA so I can get a house.

is a constant refrain in Silicon Valley — a place where 91% of venture capitalists are men, 98% are white or Asian, and almost 90% of their funding goes to white-male led ventures.

It seems like if you buy the pint of vanilla ice cream over the chocolate pint 98 out of 100 times you walk into the grocery store, you might have some ingrained preference for vanilla, no? Maybe you think you have open taste buds, but if vanilla is on the front of the shelf, and it’s a brand you recognize, it’s just the easiest thing to pick up and move on with your day. You’re not looking to see if something else might be available, and equally or more delicious, hiding in plain sight. You’re moving on autopilot, and thus eating a lot of vanilla, whether or not it’s good for you. And that’s what’s most tragic about the status quo – it not only hurts those who aren’t getting chosen, but also the person doing the choosing. 

Venture capitalists, and the asset owners and managers who fund them, pride themselves on being open-minded when it comes to allocating capital: “I don’t care if they are black, blue or have purple spots, as long as they are great managers who can make money.” They view themselves as fully available to new flavors, spotting trends before others do in order to capture the best returns in a competitive market. 

But they are forgetting about the notion of unconscious bias, the ingrained habits we get from society that are extra difficult to root out. Like breathing while sleeping, they happen so naturally we don’t even acknowledge their existence. We only see the outcome — that we don’t die in our sleep (if we are lucky), and we wind up with portfolios of predominantly white fund managers and entrepreneurs. 

This not only means that we as capital allocators perpetuate the vast racial and socioeconomic inequality of our society, but also that we are missing out on massive sources of innovation in a majority-minority country. These two reasons are why at Candide Group, we’ve put such an emphasis on diversity within our portfolio, with over half of funds and companies we support led by women and people of color (and in some cases, but not enough of them, by women of color, and trans and queer founders). 

It’s also why we’ve supported Illumen Capital: a new fund of funds that is specifically looking to help fund managers build stronger practices around diversity and root out unconscious bias.

Illumen was founded by Daryn Dodson, an African-American investor and fierce advocate for social equity. While — let’s face it — inequities in capital allocation are largely caused by white people like me, we are lucky that Dodson is lending his time and talent to help remedy the problem and demonstrate the true implicit benefit of diversity in VC.

Illumen recognizes this is a multi-year process, and just like any habit we wish to change, we have to essentially go through the equivalent of a 10 step program — admit we have a problem, that we are not always in control (as our unconscious biases take over), and then find new tools and strategies to change our behaviors moving forward. 

The first step toward admitting one has a problem? Data. Illumen has partnered with Stanford University’s “do tank” SPARQ (Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions) to do one of the first comprehensive, blind studies to better examine both how unconscious bias shows up, and what its impacts are. I sat down with Dodson, Dr. Ashby Monk (member of the SPARQ team and executive director of the Global Projects Center at Stanford), Dr. Hazel Markus, (co-director of SPARQ), Dr. Sarah Lyons-Padilla (a research scientist at SPARQ and leading author of the study), and Jason Henning (Senior Vice President of Investor Relations) to learn more about this report, and what investors might want to do differently as a result.

So let’s cut to the chase. What did this study show?

Dodson: The study had three key findings: 

Asset allocators have trouble gauging the competence of racially diverse teams. Asset allocators’ judgments of the team’s competence were more strongly correlated with predictions about future performance (e.g., money raised) for racially homogenous teams than for racially diverse teams.
Racially diverse teams face bias at the top. At stronger performance levels, asset allocators rated white-led funds more favorably than they did black-led funds when evaluating investment skills, competence, and social fit.
Racially diverse teams get the benefit of the doubt at the bottom, but not more funding. At weaker performance levels, asset allocators actually rated black-led teams more favorably than white-led teams in terms of overall performance, investment skills, and ability to raise money. However, asset allocators expressed little interest in investing in weaker funds, diverse or otherwise. 
Dr. Monk: The influence that these beneficial institutional investors — who control nearly $100 trillion in assets — ave on the entire chain of financial intermediation, capitalism and even society cannot be overstated. It is of the highest importance that they invest and operate without bias. This paper and its findings hopefully raise awareness of the types of biases that remain. Racial bias is still alive and well in our country and its system of capitalism, and the investment community needs to do more to counter it in order to live up to their fiduciary obligations.

Dr. Markus: This careful analysis of the judgements of actual asset allocators reveals that the same types of biases that social psychologists have long documented in many arenas of society — education, employment, and everyday social life — are also at work in the powerful financial services industry. Rather than an emphasis on “fixing”  individual financial decision-makers, however, the results suggest the value of a systematic approach to implementing practices that counteract these pervasive biases.

The results suggest first that underrepresentation of people of color in the realm of investing is not only a talent pipeline problem, and second, that funds led by people of color might paradoxically face the most barriers to advancement after they have established themselves as strong performers. 

Additional research is expected to examine solutions in more depth.  However, investing experts advising on the study believe that research, awareness-raising, professional training, and coaching as well as intentional changes to long-time industry practices, can improve the future make-up and impact of the investment community, changing the power dynamic to one that is more equitable and culturally significant.



How was the study structured? How much confidence do you have in the results — were some data points stronger or weaker?

Dodson: In terms of the methodology, we asked 180 asset allocators to rate venture capital funds based on a one-page summary of the fund’s performance history. The funds were fictional but the accompanying one-pagers were realistic, containing short summaries of the team’s track record and investment strategies. We manipulated the race of the managing partner (white or black) and the strength of the one-pager quality (stronger or weaker). Asset allocators saw one of four versions of these one-pagers. We conducted statistical analyses to determine how much managing partner race and one-pager quality affected asset allocators’ ratings of the teams. 

Dr. Lyons-Padilla: Identifying the root of racial disparities in investing is challenging because there are so few people of color in this space to begin with. Are investors biased against racially diverse teams, or is there just not enough diversity in the pipeline? We decided our first step should be to design a controlled experiment that could tell us whether, all qualifications equal, racially diverse teams face more scrutiny than their racially homogeneous counterparts.

The research team explored three distinct theories that could explain disparities in investing: 1) there is no investor bias against funds owned by people of color, suggesting that the issue is primarily a talent pipeline problem; 2) bias exists predominantly at weaker levels of performance – below the bar; and 3) bias exists predominantly at stronger levels of performance—above the bar.  

The study examined differences in judgment among asset allocators when all details about a fund’s track record and qualifications were kept constant except race.  Through an online experiment with actual asset allocators, the research team sought to determine whether there are biases in their evaluations of funds owned by black men in particular, and, if so, how these biases manifest.  

As the report highlights, “asset allocators” operate via pension funds, endowments, foundations, and sovereign funds, performing two key functions for society and their sponsors: providing high rates of return for the organizations they represent and acting as the base of the global capitalist system, allocating their funds to countless investment opportunities around the world, often through for-profit financial intermediaries (venture capitalists, hedge funds, private equity funds) managed by professional fund managers who attempt to generate a high investment return. If asset allocators set incorrect or biased incentives, the entire capitalist system will reflect and reinforce these biases.

Furthermore, while there are $69.1 trillion of global financial assets under management across mutual funds, hedge funds, real estate and private equity, fewer than 1.3 percent are managed by women and people of color.  A comprehensive data set of every venture capital organization and investor since 1990 shows that the industry has remained “relatively homogeneous”  for the past 28 years, particularly white and male. Women represent only 8 percent of investors. Hispanics make-up just 2 percent of venture capitalist investors and fewer than 1 percent are black.  And there has been no systematic investigation of the factors that cause those disparities in investment decision-making until now.  

Henning: For the main study, participants were 180 asset allocators recruited from the mailing list of an investment professionals magazine (161 men, 9 women, 10 gender not reported). A priori power analysis had determined that a sample of 128 would offer sufficient statistical power. Results from this 180-person sample proved statistically significant.  Put another way, it's more than chance that the respondents rated white-led teams higher than racially diverse teams — and, given the only difference in the fact sheets of equal fund performance was the race of the managing director, we found evidence of racial bias in these investment decisions.



This was a study using fictional funds. Surely you’ve also encountered these sorts of situations as real-life scenarios. What sort of anecdotes have you heard? 

Dodson: I’ve observed investors leaving money on the table because they underestimate the value of funds managed by people of color and women. But many of these investors did not seem to harbor conscious prejudices or even notice their biased behavior. This leads me to believe that the problem can be addressed, but we must first clearly define why these issues exist. This is true for professionals in the impact investing space too, who, seeking to improve society and achieve returns can never fully reach their goals without addressing racial bias.



What are steps investors can take if they want to address their unconscious bias? How will it benefit them… and the world? 

Dodson: We’ve developed five key recommendations for investors:

Look beyond the pipeline problem. While the talent pipeline question has been rightfully examined and remains a key part of the solution, it alone will not solve the problem. A diverse population of entrepreneurs and fund managers already exists and the industry must create practices to ensure that their pipeline reflects that diversity. 
Follow through with intentions to diversify. At weaker levels of performance, black-male-led teams in the study received higher ratings than white-male-led teams, suggesting an opportunity to increase diverse teams’ access to capital. However, allocators in the study were not seriously considering investing in weaker funds. It takes more than reviewing a one-pager or taking the first meeting to diversify a portfolio; investors must set diversity benchmarks at each step of the decision-making process. 
Support strong diverse teams. The data suggest that the more qualified diverse teams are, the more bias they face. To get at the root of the challenge, decision-makers must support strong diverse teams who are still struggling to advance. 
Amplify the presence of diverse teams. The study results suggest that asset allocators have trouble gauging the difference between strong and weak teams led by people of color. This may be for a lack of experience with diverse teams, but not for the lack of diverse teams. Allocators should become knowledgeable about successful diverse teams and distribute this knowledge throughout their networks. 
Establish a transparent selection process. Asset allocators in the study assigned different ratings to teams with identical credentials. To ensure that all teams have a fair shot, investors need to define specific selection criteria, apply these criteria consistently, and make their decision-making process transparent.

&lt;p&gt;is a constant refrain in Silicon Valley — a place where 91% of venture capitalists are men, 98% are white or Asian, and almost 90% of their funding goes to white-male led ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like if you buy the pint of vanilla ice cream over the chocolate pint 98 out of 100 times you walk into the grocery store, you might have some ingrained preference for vanilla, no? Maybe you think you have open taste buds, but if vanilla is on the front of the shelf, and it’s a brand you recognize, it’s just the easiest thing to pick up and move on with your day. You’re not looking to see if something else might be available, and equally or more delicious, hiding in plain sight. You’re moving on autopilot, and thus eating a lot of vanilla, whether or not it’s good for you. And that’s what’s most tragic about the status quo – it not only hurts those who aren’t getting chosen, but also the person doing the choosing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venture capitalists, and the asset owners and managers who fund them, pride themselves on being open-minded when it comes to allocating capital: “I don’t care if they are black, blue or have purple spots, as long as they are great managers who can make money.” They view themselves as fully available to new flavors, spotting trends before others do in order to capture the best returns in a competitive market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they are forgetting about the notion of unconscious bias, the ingrained habits we get from society that are extra difficult to root out. Like breathing while sleeping, they happen so naturally we don’t even acknowledge their existence. We only see the outcome — that we don’t die in our sleep (if we are lucky), and we wind up with portfolios of predominantly white fund managers and entrepreneurs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This not only means that we as capital allocators perpetuate the vast racial and socioeconomic inequality of our society, but also that we are missing out on massive sources of innovation in a majority-minority country. These two reasons are why at Candide Group, we’ve put such an emphasis on diversity within our portfolio, with over half of funds and companies we support led by women and people of color (and in some cases, but not enough of them, by women of color, and trans and queer founders). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also why we’ve supported Illumen Capital: a new fund of funds that is specifically looking to help fund managers build stronger practices around diversity and root out unconscious bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illumen was founded by Daryn Dodson, an African-American investor and fierce advocate for social equity. While — let’s face it — inequities in capital allocation are largely caused by white people like me, we are lucky that Dodson is lending his time and talent to help remedy the problem and demonstrate the true implicit benefit of diversity in VC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illumen recognizes this is a multi-year process, and just like any habit we wish to change, we have to essentially go through the equivalent of a 10 step program — admit we have a problem, that we are not always in control (as our unconscious biases take over), and then find new tools and strategies to change our behaviors moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step toward admitting one has a problem? Data. Illumen has partnered with Stanford University’s “do tank” SPARQ (Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions) to do one of the first comprehensive, blind studies to better examine both how unconscious bias shows up, and what its impacts are. I sat down with Dodson, Dr. Ashby Monk (member of the SPARQ team and executive director of the Global Projects Center at Stanford), Dr. Hazel Markus, (co-director of SPARQ), Dr. Sarah Lyons-Padilla (a research scientist at SPARQ and leading author of the study), and Jason Henning (Senior Vice President of Investor Relations) to learn more about this report, and what investors might want to do differently as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s cut to the chase. What did this study show?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodson: The study had three key findings: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asset allocators have trouble gauging the competence of racially diverse teams. Asset allocators’ judgments of the team’s competence were more strongly correlated with predictions about future performance (e.g., money raised) for racially homogenous teams than for racially diverse teams.
Racially diverse teams face bias at the top. At stronger performance levels, asset allocators rated white-led funds more favorably than they did black-led funds when evaluating investment skills, competence, and social fit.
Racially diverse teams get the benefit of the doubt at the bottom, but not more funding. At weaker performance levels, asset allocators actually rated black-led teams more favorably than white-led teams in terms of overall performance, investment skills, and ability to raise money. However, asset allocators expressed little interest in investing in weaker funds, diverse or otherwise. 
Dr. Monk: The influence that these beneficial institutional investors — who control nearly $100 trillion in assets — ave on the entire chain of financial intermediation, capitalism and even society cannot be overstated. It is of the highest importance that they invest and operate without bias. This paper and its findings hopefully raise awareness of the types of biases that remain. Racial bias is still alive and well in our country and its system of capitalism, and the investment community needs to do more to counter it in order to live up to their fiduciary obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Markus: This careful analysis of the judgements of actual asset allocators reveals that the same types of biases that social psychologists have long documented in many arenas of society — education, employment, and everyday social life — are also at work in the powerful financial services industry. Rather than an emphasis on “fixing”  individual financial decision-makers, however, the results suggest the value of a systematic approach to implementing practices that counteract these pervasive biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results suggest first that underrepresentation of people of color in the realm of investing is not only a talent pipeline problem, and second, that funds led by people of color might paradoxically face the most barriers to advancement after they have established themselves as strong performers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional research is expected to examine solutions in more depth.  However, investing experts advising on the study believe that research, awareness-raising, professional training, and coaching as well as intentional changes to long-time industry practices, can improve the future make-up and impact of the investment community, changing the power dynamic to one that is more equitable and culturally significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was the study structured? How much confidence do you have in the results — were some data points stronger or weaker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodson: In terms of the methodology, we asked 180 asset allocators to rate venture capital funds based on a one-page summary of the fund’s performance history. The funds were fictional but the accompanying one-pagers were realistic, containing short summaries of the team’s track record and investment strategies. We manipulated the race of the managing partner (white or black) and the strength of the one-pager quality (stronger or weaker). Asset allocators saw one of four versions of these one-pagers. We conducted statistical analyses to determine how much managing partner race and one-pager quality affected asset allocators’ ratings of the teams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lyons-Padilla: Identifying the root of racial disparities in investing is challenging because there are so few people of color in this space to begin with. Are investors biased against racially diverse teams, or is there just not enough diversity in the pipeline? We decided our first step should be to design a controlled experiment that could tell us whether, all qualifications equal, racially diverse teams face more scrutiny than their racially homogeneous counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team explored three distinct theories that could explain disparities in investing: 1) there is no investor bias against funds owned by people of color, suggesting that the issue is primarily a talent pipeline problem; 2) bias exists predominantly at weaker levels of performance – below the bar; and 3) bias exists predominantly at stronger levels of performance—above the bar.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study examined differences in judgment among asset allocators when all details about a fund’s track record and qualifications were kept constant except race.  Through an online experiment with actual asset allocators, the research team sought to determine whether there are biases in their evaluations of funds owned by black men in particular, and, if so, how these biases manifest.  &lt;/p&gt;

I have a large amount in cash just sitting around in a money market fund, and I feel like I should do something with some of it. It's potentially for an apartment or house down payment in 2-3 years, so with that kind of short time frame I don't want to expose myself to large downside risks like equities with this money (I have other equity investments).

I am curious if anyone else is in a similar situation where they are also a CA resident in a 32%+ federal tax bracket.

At this point, a bond fund that produces current regular income is a lot less valuable to me than others. With a marginal tax rate of over 40%, some corporate or emerging market 4%ish bond fund yield would realistically barely beat inflation (4% \* (1-0.4) = 2.4% post tax yield). Such a low yield doesn't seem worth the downside risk (10%+) of bond fund ETFs compared to my FDIC insured money market yield of 2% ish (or 1.2% post-tax).

Some options I have researched:

\- US treasuries might be free from state tax? that slightly helps by 10% or so

\- CA municipal bonds are apparently federal tax free? Are there ETFs for Cali muni bonds that are known to meet the tax free status that are available?

\- Do I chase high yield in risky bond funds? This seems strictly worse than just investing further in stocks where I could go for high growth and low dividend - and pay cap gains instead","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

How will America’s economic portfolio change in the next few decades as we race toward 2050 when racial minorities are expected to emerge as the majority of the U.S. population?

Investing today to uplift America’s minority students and innovators seems prudent.

{snip}

I don’t know where the notion was conceived that the election of a Black leader would, in an instant, mitigate the economic imprisonment and wealth gap established by institutions of oppressive policies and practices that have remained from post-slavery to this presumed “post-racial” era.

{snip}

The main economic categories that offer insight into a significantly divided Black and White America are simply: education and jobs.

{snip}

Consider that 87 percent of eighth-graders in high-poverty schools are not proficient in math. 88 percent are not proficient in reading.

The data indicate another economic crisis is set to hit the nation in 2015. Millions of unqualified students will flood the job market unable to obtain livable wages and engage in productive work.

What will become of these masses of minorities in whom the nation has failed to adequately invest?

{snip}

{snip} Unfortunately, no data suggests that government has ever been the answer to the employment problem for Black Americans in any substantive way. In fact, the data suggest just the opposite:

Since the days of Dr. Martin Luther King’s call for jobs from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 to this very day, unemployment among Black Americans has remained nearly double the overall jobless rate every year in a pattern so consistent that it is the focus of discussions and debates among those who have knowledge of the data.

{snip}

Historically, no such institutional investment focus has targeted regions predominantly dominated by African Americans. Historically, White American business owners have been reluctant to employ Blacks; and diversity, which receives some lip service, isn’t high on the priority list for leaders in White corporations and White-owned small businesses that dominate America’s job market.

{snip}

The revenue generated by all Black-owned business is less than 1 percent of GDP.

The National Venture Capital Association boasts venture-backed companies produced $2.9T. That revenue amounted to 21% of the nation’s $14T GDP in 2008. Compare that to Asian-owned businesses that produced $2.5T and employed half of all employed minorities in the nation.

{snip}

We’re racing toward the year 2050. It’s time to invest in those promising minority students and talented innovators who have failed to receive our focus and investment. After all, at the rate minority populations are growing, they represent the next generation of America’s leaders building the American Dream of the 21st century.

Holding cash into recessions seems to have been better than just riding the up and down of the market.

One argument I have seen is that it's hard to call the top or bottom. Which doesn't make much sense because how much cash Berkshire Hathaway is holding is public info. Which means if you want to time the market as well as them, you just have match your cash percentage to theirs. So timing the market is pretty easy if you are paying attention. 

Another argument is what if you are wrong? Which also doesn't make much sense either because if people paid much more than you are doing it and are proven to be right over a long time frame, why would you not follow what they choose to do here? Anyways being balanced towards more cash as the economy cycle progresses doesn't stop you from making gains on investments you already have. And a drop of 50% during a recession means you'd have to go up 100% to get back to where you were, if you believe market won't likely double before recession, there is little point in chasing the top, all the advantage is in having as much money as possible to buy when things are down. 

Another point would be why not just buy BRK stock and hold it and let Berkshire do their thing, which would give you market timing anyways. This overlooks the fact that you'd still make more money timing the market because even though BRK made money in the long run by buying during recessions, their stock was still down during recessions. 

Finally, people might say, ""just because it worked before doesn't mean it will work in the future."" which the same argument can be used against investing in the first place. There is no reason to expect returns from the market at 8% a year except that is happens in the past. No reason to expect stocks to keep going up except it's been going up. Economic cycles have exists for a long time, timing them seem very productive as an investor.  

The only possible argument on why not to do it seems to be laziness.

-customs
-time of shipment
-insurance
-customer service

-i would probably need a poll directed to the potential customers to understand the maximum amount of money I can ask for these additional services that I offer in order to make a realistic costs/benefits analysis.
What do you think? Contact me if you can help me in case,
Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

I am a new investor, mid-30 wanting to start investing. I have been thinking of dividing my investing strategy as follow:

* Income Strategy: High Yield Div. ETFs + High Bond Yield combo
* Long Term Saving Strategy: Total World Stock Market + Emerging Market.
* Individual stock allocations focusing on Value Growth

The allocation would be 35%, 60% and 5%.

My reasoning is the following:

* Income Strategy to develop a portfolio that can generate a second income. I don't plan to target retirement anytime soon but one can dream right? The ETFs aren't necessarily long term holdings so I expect some turnaround if i need to switch to different ETFs or allocation of Equities/Bonds where I think the yield would be better in the future.

* Long Term Saving Strategy is a fixed allocation of owning the whole world and would be where I hope to compound overtime. Dividends are automatically re-invested.

* 5% for stocks where I see Growth at discount - making use of recession.

My question: does this make sense? should I forgot the Income Strategy and simply put that 35% allocation into the Long Term Saving strategy?

Thanks guys!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

Long story short, I transferred my money from this brokerage as quickly as possible once I found out this information and am closing out the account today.  I am so done with all of this.  I feel like the bank and advisor did not act in my best interest, and I didn’t even know about it until recently.  Is this a reportable offense to the SEC?  (I don’t want to throw my dad through the loop because he has a lot of health issues, so I’ll drop it if that is the case).&lt;/p&gt;

In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I&amp;#39;m going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone&amp;#39;s formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I&amp;#39;m going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First lets address politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it&amp;#39;s entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn&amp;#39;t nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the simple guideline which I&amp;#39;ll expand on: you&amp;#39;re free to express your opinion so long as it&amp;#39;s tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it&amp;#39;s civil.&lt;/strong&gt;  We&amp;#39;re not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tied to investing:&lt;/strong&gt; this should be pretty straightforward but I&amp;#39;m laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization&amp;#39;s potential biases, etc.  If it&amp;#39;s not in the first list it&amp;#39;s probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effort:&lt;/strong&gt; no shitposts.  If you&amp;#39;re not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it&amp;#39;s probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like &amp;quot;fuck my portfolio&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn&amp;#39;t going to fly here.  That means if you&amp;#39;re repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn&amp;#39;t tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your post should be something like &amp;quot;I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah&amp;quot;.  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civility:&lt;/strong&gt; so we already don&amp;#39;t allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn&amp;#39;t an appropriate subreddit for that.  We&amp;#39;re here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;/r/investing&lt;/a&gt; is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that the guidelines are made clear, here&amp;#39;s the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we&amp;#39;re automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.

For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Corporate vs Investment News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Matinas is an interesting company that has a prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid-based composition (similar to Vascepa) under development for reducing triglycerides (named MAT9001). Importantly it has shown superiority versus Amarin's Vascepa for the same indications..

Amarin’s stock has risen 10x over the past year as it has successfully progressed towards approval for Vascepa. Most recently an FDA expert panel unanimously to recommend Amarin's Vascepa for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke.

However back in 2015, Matinas was conducting a phase I trial of its own omega 3 drug MAT9001, comparing it directly with Vascepa. It found that MAT9001 was much more effective than Vascepa at reducing triglycerides and VLDL-C. MAT9001 saw a 33.2% reduction from baseline versus 10.5% for Vascepa, and VLDL-C reduction was at 32.5% versus 8.1% for Vascepa. Despite that trial's success, Matinas put MAT9001 on the backburner while it used its resources to develop its lead antifungal candidate.

The company has since revived MAT9001 with a 100-patient Phase II crossover head-to-head trial against Vascepa on patients with high triglycerides that will begin dosing next quarter, with results expected by the end of 2020.

There is no guarantee that it will succeed and even if it does the approval process will probably take a while. However the results so far are encouraging and the insider purchases send a clear signal that senior management is confident in success. 

The stock price has increased almost 100% but, with a market valuation of just $200 million compared to $7.63 billion for Amarin, there could be a lot more upside for investors who join the CFO and Vice Chairman.

More insider buying at **Assured Guaranty Ltd** on November 25th &amp; 26th as Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Feldstein, purchase another $1.9 million of stock. That brings the total number of purchases over the past month to 10. 

The company is a monoline guarantor that insures municipal and structured debt issuance. It ran into trouble during the great recession but has staged something of a recovery and Mr Feldstein seems to be highly confident in its future.

Two points of interest that caught my eye;

1. The company estimates it’s non GAAP adjusted book value at $90.18 compared to Fridays close at $49.65 (GAAP valuation of $68.94 also compares well)

2. The company CEO said on the Q2 earnings call that he believed the firm had $3.2 billion of excess capital beyond what was required to maintain its AAA rating. A meaningful amount for a company with a market capitalization of $4.7 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On November 20th, Chief Executive Officer Lee Jacobson purchased $352,154 worth of **Nesco Holdings**, picking up the stock after a drop of almost 70% this year. 

Nesco is one of the largest specialty equipment rental providers to the electric utility transmission and distribution, telecom and rail industries in North America. It reported mixed Q3 results a couple of weeks ago with revenues down 2.6% and a loss of $18 million but the company generated solid revenue growth in both the equipment rental (up 7.3%) and parts, tools, and accessories businesses (up 51.2%), as well as the 13th consecutive quarter of growth in adjusted EBITDA (up 7.5%).

At the time Lee Jacobson, CEO of Nesco, remarked ""We continue to see considerable opportunities for organic growth, supported by growing customer backlogs within our core electric utility markets, increased market penetration of the rail and telecom markets and further penetration of the parts tools and accessories offering across our existing equipment rental customer base. Shortages for specialty rental equipment in the markets we serve have continued and our customer rental contract periods have lengthened to record levels, further supporting our planned investment in fleet growth.”

That looks like a good outlook from Mr Jacobson and, having almost doubled his shareholding, he has backed that up with his own cash. The stock has dropped a further 10% and, trading on 0.6x revenues, other investors may want to have a look too.

**Comscore’s** new CEO, Bill Livek, snapped up $1 million of stock on November 12th (along with a few other insider purchases) following Q3 results. That should only enhance the strong incentives already in place for him to deliver a sale of the company at an advantageous value for investors. Livek, a 30-year veteran of the media and data measurement market, will receive a $1 million cash bonus from a sale. However, he will get an additional cash bonus (based on a percentage of the gross transaction if the sale yields $500 million or more in proceeds). That’s a 75% premium to Friday’s closing market capitalization of $286 million.

There was insider buying at **Zovio** on November 5th, by Chief Executive Officer Andrew S. Clark who purchased 150,000 shares for a cost of $2.58 each, for a total investment of $386,505. Zovio has fallen back to $2.30 since then but is up 44% since reporting Q3 results on October 31. 

On that call the education technology services company (and owner of online Ashford University) outlined a restructuring plan to drive cost savings totalling $51 million in 2020 and drive the company back to profitability with guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.50 to$0.90. If successful the current stock price of $2.02 would be a bargain. The CEO’s purchase is an encouraging endorsement.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, both the CFO and Vice Chairman at &lt;strong&gt;Matinas BioPharma&lt;/strong&gt; made $100,000+ purchases of stock. Matinas is an interesting company that has a prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid-based composition (similar to Vascepa) under development for reducing triglycerides (named MAT9001). Importantly it has shown superiority versus Amarin&amp;#39;s Vascepa for the same indications..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amarin’s stock has risen 10x over the past year as it has successfully progressed towards approval for Vascepa. Most recently an FDA expert panel unanimously to recommend Amarin&amp;#39;s Vascepa for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However back in 2015, Matinas was conducting a phase I trial of its own omega 3 drug MAT9001, comparing it directly with Vascepa. It found that MAT9001 was much more effective than Vascepa at reducing triglycerides and VLDL-C. MAT9001 saw a 33.2% reduction from baseline versus 10.5% for Vascepa, and VLDL-C reduction was at 32.5% versus 8.1% for Vascepa. Despite that trial&amp;#39;s success, Matinas put MAT9001 on the backburner while it used its resources to develop its lead antifungal candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has since revived MAT9001 with a 100-patient Phase II crossover head-to-head trial against Vascepa on patients with high triglycerides that will begin dosing next quarter, with results expected by the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee that it will succeed and even if it does the approval process will probably take a while. However the results so far are encouraging and the insider purchases send a clear signal that senior management is confident in success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock price has increased almost 100% but, with a market valuation of just $200 million compared to $7.63 billion for Amarin, there could be a lot more upside for investors who join the CFO and Vice Chairman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More insider buying at &lt;strong&gt;Assured Guaranty Ltd&lt;/strong&gt; on November 25th &amp;amp; 26th as Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Feldstein, purchase another $1.9 million of stock. That brings the total number of purchases over the past month to 10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is a monoline guarantor that insures municipal and structured debt issuance. It ran into trouble during the great recession but has staged something of a recovery and Mr Feldstein seems to be highly confident in its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two points of interest that caught my eye;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company estimates it’s non GAAP adjusted book value at $90.18 compared to Fridays close at $49.65 (GAAP valuation of $68.94 also compares well)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company CEO said on the Q2 earnings call that he believed the firm had $3.2 billion of excess capital beyond what was required to maintain its AAA rating. A meaningful amount for a company with a market capitalization of $4.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 20th, Chief Executive Officer Lee Jacobson purchased $352,154 worth of &lt;strong&gt;Nesco Holdings&lt;/strong&gt;, picking up the stock after a drop of almost 70% this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nesco is one of the largest specialty equipment rental providers to the electric utility transmission and distribution, telecom and rail industries in North America. It reported mixed Q3 results a couple of weeks ago with revenues down 2.6% and a loss of $18 million but the company generated solid revenue growth in both the equipment rental (up 7.3%) and parts, tools, and accessories businesses (up 51.2%), as well as the 13th consecutive quarter of growth in adjusted EBITDA (up 7.5%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time Lee Jacobson, CEO of Nesco, remarked &amp;quot;We continue to see considerable opportunities for organic growth, supported by growing customer backlogs within our core electric utility markets, increased market penetration of the rail and telecom markets and further penetration of the parts tools and accessories offering across our existing equipment rental customer base. Shortages for specialty rental equipment in the markets we serve have continued and our customer rental contract periods have lengthened to record levels, further supporting our planned investment in fleet growth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That looks like a good outlook from Mr Jacobson and, having almost doubled his shareholding, he has backed that up with his own cash. The stock has dropped a further 10% and, trading on 0.6x revenues, other investors may want to have a look too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

BEIJING, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Beijing's top priority in any phase one trade deal with the United States is the removal of existing tariffs on Chinese goods, China's Global Times newspaper said on Sunday, amid continued uncertainty on whether the two sides can strike a deal.

""Sources with direct knowledge of the trade talks told the Global Times on Saturday that the U.S. must remove existing tariffs, not planned tariffs, as part of the deal,"" said the report.

Global Times, published by the official People's Daily newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, also cited another unidentified source close to the talks as saying U.S. officials had been resisting such a demand because the tariffs were their only weapon in the trade war and giving up that weapon meant ""surrender.""

On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington was in the ""final throes"" of a deal aimed at defusing a 16-month trade war with China, a few days after Chinese President Xi Jinping had expressed his desire for a trade agreement. Top trade negotiators for both countries also spoke again and agreed to continue working on the remaining issues.

Trade experts and people close to the White House told Reuters last month, however, that signing a phase one agreement may not take place until the new year as China pressed for more extensive rollbacks of tariffs. An agreement was initially expected to be completed by the end of November.

U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley told reporters on Tuesday that Beijing invited U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for in-person talks in Beijing.

Grassley said Lighthizer and Mnuchin were willing to go if they saw ""a real chance of getting a final agreement"".","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Beijing&amp;#39;s top priority in any phase one trade deal with the United States is the removal of existing tariffs on Chinese goods, China&amp;#39;s Global Times newspaper said on Sunday, amid continued uncertainty on whether the two sides can strike a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking for a quite specific type of book about investing. I'm a college student, I've already had some finance / investing classes, and I'll have more in the future. I believe I know the basics, but I still have a lot to learn.

I'd like to read something that's entertaining and anecdotic but also educational at the same time (so basically something between The Wolf of Wall Street and a finance textbook). I would like the book to be centered around the valuable experience / wisdom of the writer, not just the raw explanation of certain theories. So far I've found One Up On Wall Street to be the best choice, but I figured I'd ask your opinion.

Thanks in advance!

P.S. I've read the book recommendation list, but that only took me so far.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys!&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted also an Spanish company that I knew to invest on, preferably that I was a client of it, a company with international presence, and did well when the economy goes down.

I landed in DIA supermarkets, third biggest supermarket chain in Spain, has presence in South America, is the biggest public supermarket company in Europe, and it's well know by having offers and cheap prices so it did fairly good during last crash.

Little I knew, Bought some shares and one week after they announced that last trimester result calculations were off/inflated, share price went down, and a shitshow started where the company got targeted by Mijail Friedman, a Russian oligarch that ended up owning almost 70% of the shares, and a capital expansion.

Anyways I still think that the company has value and now with the ticket price at its lowest more than even, but I'm an amateur, so I'd like to know more educated guesses.
